It is not  performed as often as it deserves, and this video production (not  problem-free) may be the only one available for quite a while.  Fans of Rossini will find it worth playing. Like most opera  videos, it was recorded in a live performance, including  audience applause in which viewers may or may not wish to join.  Live recordings can have a spontaneity not always heard in studio  work, but small vocal problems--particularly near the beginning  when voices are warming up--go uncorrected. The singing often  needs to be spectacular, and it usually is once the solo voices have  settled down, but you have to make a few allowances.

To learn why Fido fights and puppies play, Spin--the animated planet guide voiced by Dudley Moore--introduces viewers to wolves, coyotes, African wild dogs, and a bat-eared fox. When Spin isn\'t drawing comparisons between pet dogs and their ancestors, viewers are treated to specially written pop songs such as "Hey Dog," in which dogs howl the chorus. There\'s a moving segment featuring a working dog\'s relationship with the disabled boy he assists. Cats get similar treatment (minus the part about helping people) with Tabby\'s hunting, clawing, and rubbing habits compared to those of lions, tigers, and other big cats. There are the usual jokes about who owns whom when it comes to the pet cat, and the unavoidable footage of African cats turning wildebeest into breakfast.

The trio essentially take the rhythm-driven approach ofOptical Raceand make it more palatable and radio-friendly, as evidenced by the lackluster sax melodies on the title track. The album features many instrumentals that have a similar feeling--relatively energetic and upbeat, but also a bit fluffy. There are some grittier moments to be found, foremost on the haunting "Three Bikes in the Sky," a slow-moving, atmospheric piece with searing electric guitar work, while the lively electro-rock of "Dolls in the Shadow" and "Yucatan" also stand out. Tangerine Dream have never shied away from the obvious synthetic sounds of their work--it\'s a big part of their raison d\'etre, after all--but here the machines seem to exert just as much influence as the humans behind them.

Not that it matters, really. Whatever you call the style--"contemporary instrumental" seems as good a term as any--Matsui is one of its more appealing, and certainly most popular, exponents. A capable if not virtuosic player, she and her four-piece band (including a Japanese guitarist who seems to have listened to a lot more Jimi Hendrix than Jim Hall) offer up a generous set of 14 songs, all of them Matsui compositions. As titles like "Beyond the Light," "Night Waltz" and "Bridge over the Stars" would indicate, the sound is melodic, accessible, and, well, smooth; this is the kind of music that smooth-jazz radio was created for. And while that makes for few challenging moments, Matsui does provide enough variety--say, the minor-key, rhythmic drive of "Doll," or the shifting dynamics of "Foot Steps" (the two "jazziest" numbers here)--to keep things interesting. Best of all, she brings out Kazu Matsui, her husband and record producer, to play the shakuhachi (the Japanese wooden flute) on the final three numbers. Kazu\'s distinctively breathy sound and casual, humorous mien provide a welcome change of pace in a show that is otherwise a bit too safe for its own good.--Sam Graham', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41GZKERJEJL._SY300_.jpg', 19.97, true),

The mix of classic tunes ("I Get a Kick Out of You," "The Lady Is a Tramp," "Witchcraft"), key songs from his 1950s reinvention ("Come Fly with Me," "You Make Me Feel So Young"), and 1960s standards ("My Kind of Town," "This Is All I Ask") is mirrored in an effective medley anchored by "It Was a Very Good Year," giving us a brief tour of his career from the bobby-soxer heartthrob crooning hopeful ditties ("Young at Heart") to the reflective maturity of the artist in 1965 (the melancholy "Last Night When We Were Young"). Vocally, Sinatra is in excellent form--clear and bold, with the dexterity of his 1950s recordings now colored by phrasing at once thoughtful and seemingly spontaneous--and the combination of top-notch arrangements and impeccably chosen material makes this special Sinatra\'s finest televised hour.--Sean Axmaker', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JAY2JZG6L._SY300_.jpg', 22.98, true);

Part of Shostakovich\'s opera is left out, but what  remains has a coherent dramatic impact, intensified by a heavy  serving of graphically explicit, precisely choreographed sex and  violence. This is a hybrid, like Petr Weigl\'s film of Donizetti\'sMaria  Stuarda, but more smoothly executed. It does not shift between  spoken German and sung Italian like that curious, intriguing production,  but Weigl has again taken an outstanding opera recording, cut it  down, and used it as the soundtrack for a film, with Czech  performers providing the visual dimension. It works more smoothly  here than it did inMaria Stuarda. The musical and theatrical  performances are both extraordinary. The lip synchronization to the  Russian text is not always precise, but the physical gestures  coordinate with and visually reinforce the musical effects. The  scenery, costumes, and atmosphere are realistic and convincing, and they add a compelling dimension to the experience.Musically, thisLady Macbeth of Mtsenskis not likely to be  surpassed in the foreseeable future. It is not true, as the  back cover says, that Shostakovich wrote the title role for Galina Vishnevskaya; she was not quite 10 years old when it was written.  But she and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich became close friends of Shostakovich, and their recording, with a carefully picked cast, is a basic  document on how this opera should sound.

To sidestep those conventions (and, one suspects, to showcase the star\'s modest performing gifts to best advantage), director Jack Haley Jr. shotMovin\' with Nancyon film in and around Los Angeles, yielding sequences that anticipate the visual experiments that would characterize music videos more than a decade later.The results are intriguing: for Sinatra\'s fans, the chance to see her in all her leggy, miniskirted glory will be irresistible, but amateur pop sociologists will be at least as fascinated by the period details and some unwittingly bizarre undercurrents.  For the putative teen viewers of the day, there\'s the psychedelic montage of "Some Velvet Morning," one of several duets with Sinatra\'s frequent partner at that time, Lee Hazlewood (a country-tinged, B-team Sonny to her blonde variation on Cher), interweaving the two singers on horseback and making much out of bewildering references to Phaedra. For the grownups, there are segments teaming her with Dean Martin (awkwardly addressed as her "god-uncle") and Sammy Davis Jr., as well as a reverential sequence in which she caresses oversized posters of her famous father (including a still from his then-current crime feature,Tony Rome, depicting him with a menacing pistol) that raises all sorts of knotty psychiatric issues.The mix of Rat Pack glitz, flower power, and mainstream pop gets an added kick with Day-Glo fashions cut to Carnaby Street lines, vintage commercials for Royal Crown Cola ("It\'s a mad, mad, mad, mad cola!"), and pop covers that likewise lock in a sense of temporal dislocation as Nancy gamely tackles "Up, Up and Away" (in a hot air balloon, of course) and "Who Will Buy?" fromOliver!, here goosed with go-go powered dancing.--Sam Sutherland', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HB6R9N6ZL._SY300_.jpg', 11.28, true),

Filmed in Mexico City before a huge reverent crowd, the concert balances close-ups against the quartet\'s often mesmerizing staging effects; the camera work sustains a sense of the show\'s outsized physical setting, while expertly closing the distance between us and the band.The band also shrewdly integrates older songs into the pumped up, burnished arranging style heard onPopwhile stripping down newer material in less varnished, more vulnerable settings.

What you will see on this disc is a staged version ofDas Lied von der Erde. Beginning with the words "When music is for the eyes to see," we are told in a preamble that Mahler has returned from America "pale and ghostly." We watch as the music reveals his inner struggles, torments, and remembrances of his dead children. Is this a good way to go about presentingDas Lied? That\'s entirely up to you. The performance by the Bass-Normandy Orchestral Ensemble conducted by Dominique Debart is really quite good. A further warning: the music is performed in a transcription for 13&nbsp;musicians by Arnold Sch&ouml;nberg. This may elicit gasping from purists, but rest assured that the playing is very good, and the quiet moments have a wonderful transparency. Don\'t be fooled, though: 13&nbsp;people (no trumpets  or trombones, only one percussionist) cannot begin to approach the kind of volume that one traditionally associates with Mahler. The singing by tenor Vincent  de&nbsp;Rooster and mezzo-soprano Helene Jossoud is first rate. The interpretation has moments of real sweep and beauty. Also on the disc is theKindertotenliederin another arrangement for small forces, this time by the conductor, Amaury du Clossel. This is a traditional performance video, and a rather boring one; the singing by mezzo-soprano Claire Brua is only so-so, and the playing (this time by Atelier Lyrique et Symphonique du Centre) is not good.

Purcell took his subject fromThe Aeneid, Virgil\'s Latin epic about the destruction of Troy and the founding of Rome by a party of refugees from the fallen city. In the episode chosen by Purcell (by far the best-known in the lengthy poem), Aeneas, leader of the Trojan refugees, lands at Carthage, falls in love with the city\'s widowed Queen Dido, but goes on to fulfill his destiny in Italy while the abandoned queen commits suicide. Tafelmusik, an excellent Canadian chamber orchestra, performs baroque music with the distinctive sound of period instruments. Mezzo-soprano Jennifer Lane sings the dual roles of Dido and the jealous sorceress whose spells destroy the queen\'s liaison with Aeneas. These roles are both danced by Mark Morris. The video production gives occasional glimpses of singers, but the overwhelming emphasis is, rightly, on the dancing.Morris is equally impressive as a solo dancer and a choreographer. He has given his ensemble a strikingly expressive choreographic vocabulary, with gestures that are rooted in spontaneous body language and frequently call to mind ancient Greco-Roman visual arts. He is one  of the relatively few choreographers who actually listen to the music and  translate it precisely into stage action. His treatment ofDido and  Aeneasis a classic, and the film directing of Barbara Willis Sweete  preserves its classic qualities.--Joe McLellan', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CW06AY7YL._SY300_.jpg', 22.98, true),

Morton Feldman\'s compositions, from the starkest to the most intense, have deserved a collection of this nature for decades. To hear the string of five-part pieces (Projection,Durations, andVertical Thoughts) laid end to end is amazingly instructive. Feldman excels from his earliest at the study of pitch relationships and intricate, luminescent structures. And the Barton Workshop shows this off with a blush of restraint as they pull together Feldman\'s odd mix of sonorities (flute, trumpet, violin, cello, and piano onProjection2; violin, tuba, and piano onDurations3; flute, oboe, trombone, celeste, and percussion onInstrumentsI) without breaching the seamwork Feldman so carefully wove around his studies. As this set progresses, the study advances from one focused on pitches and timbres to one focused on sonic dynamics beyond categorization. An earlyJohn Cageacolyte, Feldman is painted by these pieces more definitively than ever as a more concise, unflinching thinker.

They are transcribed from vintage recordings, and there is plenty of humor, wisdom, and wit inherent in the Calypsonians\' lyrics to relate to the human condition in any age. Calypso has always documented politics, weather, and news stories (intermixed with racy double-entendres), and these tunes are no exception, save being from a slower, more naive period of history.

If their "Urethra Chronicles" video is to be believed, their job involves mainly  traveling around the world, being extremely childish, and playing hugely enjoyable punk pop for the masses. Basically a fly-on-the-wall look into that life, theUrethra ChroniclesDVD gives little insight into the three Blinks aside from their love of toilet humor and seeming obsession with homosexuality. The music is given frustratingly short shrift aside from the odd snippet of live performance, but you don\'t have to be a teenage boy and/or a fan to find some of this very funny. Much, however, will leave the casual observer feeling left out on a series of inside jokes. When they place their humor in the context of the music, though--as with the four promo videos also included--the result is fantastic. The Backstreet Boys pastiche "All the Small Things" not only is the pinnacle both musically and visually but also demonstrates the great Blink 182 irony--that behind the smirking, childish exterior lurk three sensitive souls, just as keen to use their video to pay tribute to their girlfriends as they are to drop their trousers.--Phil Udell', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51AceOwuzJL._SY300_.jpg', 15.11, true),

The Wolf of these \'52 sessions was just a few years off the farm, having begun to play West Memphis, Arkansas, juke joints, and cat houses following World War II. Working with a small but feral band highlighted by lead guitarist Willie Johnson (called by some theJimi Hendrixof his day), the already middle-aged singer and harmonica player created a sound in the early \'50s that bridged the Mississippi blues that were his roots with the amped Chicago blues that were his destiny. Phillips captured the man born Chester Burnett on the title track, "Drivin\' C.V.

Awkward moments show that he still has a lot to learn  about theatrical technique, but there is lots of vigor, abundant  melody, and occasionally a flash of genius. One magnificent chorus, "Va, pensiero," expresses the homesickness of Hebrew slaves in their Babylonian  captivity. It became the unofficial anthem of the Risorgimento, 19th-century  Italy\'s struggle for freedom and unity, and was sung spontaneously  in 1901 by thousands of mourners lining the streets for Verdi\'s  funeral procession. It still brings out the best in any Italian chorus, and it is the peak moment in this production--one of the few times when the   chorus deserves to be seen as well as heard. Otherwise, we have here  a fairly average evening in a provincial Italian opera house. There  are capable but not riveting performances by Renato Bruson as Nebuchadnezzar, who conquers Israel, proclaims himself God, goes mad, and loses  his throne, and Lauren Flanigan as Abigail, his wicked daughter who seizes the  throne and plans to commit genocide. Drawbacks include an uneven  supporting cast, slipshod camera work, and poor recorded sound.The visuals do capture some of the opera\'s epic scope, but until  a better video edition comes along, most Verdi fans would probably  be happier with one of the excellent audio recordings, perhaps the  one conducted byGiuseppe Sinopoli on Deutsche Grammophon.--Joe McLellan', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YDMWTKH6L._SY300_.jpg', 29.69, true),

But he first  became known to modern audiences almost exclusively for his  instrumental music. This unbalanced view does not mean that his  operatic music is inferior to his concertos. It reflects instead  economic conditions (opera costs a lot more to produce than  instrumental music) and major changes in the tastes of the opera  audience during the 19th century and much of the 20th.Baroque opera has made a comeback in popular taste in recent decades,  and this production ofOrlando furiosoembodies the genre\'s  distinctive qualities: elaborately ornamented da capo arias, the use of  high-pitched voices (originally castrati) in heroic roles, and an  intricate plot full of implausible relations, misunderstandings, and  deceptions among star-crossed lovers. The primary reason for the  recording\'s existence is the spectacular performance of Marilyn Horne  in the role of the medieval knight Orlando, legendary nephew of  Charlemagne, including a long and technically dazzling mad scene. But  the San Francisco Opera has assembled a stellar cast for the sometimes  extraordinary demands of the other roles. Particularly impressive are  Susan Patterson as Angelica, whom Orlando loves to the point of  madness, and Kathleen Kuhlmann as the wicked witch Alcina, but the  whole cast performs without significant weakness. Visually, the  production captures the fairy-tale quality of the libretto, and  conductor Randall Behr has Vivaldi\'s style, vocal and instrumental,  well in hand.--Joe McLellan', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71NJF2X81XL._SY300_.gif', 23.98, true),

The older stars sing songs from landmark original roles, while the \'90s stars tend to sing either songs they\'ve performed in revivals or songs from older shows--curiously, modern headliners such as Audra McDonald and Linda Eder sing older material rather than the contemporary shows (Ragtime,Jekyll & Hyde, respectively, among others) with which they are strongly associated.A number of these performances might be slightly inferior to those on the original recordings, but there are a number of gems, and the star power of the whole lineup is undeniable. In addition, even though only a few numbers provide action to watch, video is a valuable format for this concert because it gives faces to stars who most viewers outside of New York might recognize only by name or still photographs, and also allows fans to catch up with yesterday\'s stars.

So this feature-length, animated musical skirts a straight squaring-off of versions. The story line is a bit more complex, with the abominable snowman\'s antagonist role played by the Whoopi Goldberg-voiced Ice Queen, Stormella, and Rudolph\'s running buddies depicted as a polar bear (excellently voiced by Bob Newhart) and, not surprisingly, a cutesy doe, Zoey. The animation is first-rate and completely convincing, making this new Rudolph ideal for the discriminating 3- to 7-year-old viewer. Stormella looks for all the world like a hybrid of King Triton and Ursula, the Sea Witch from Disney\'sThe Little Mermaid. As for the story, none of it is either heavyhanded on the good versus evil front for the younger set, or so sappy that it\'s intolerable for adults. As with so many animated features this decade, the presence of seasoned actors with experience in comedy makes for dialogue that\'s entertainingly nuanced. Since there are moments of tension and conflict, the comic relief is important and unmistakable, even for younger viewers. The themes are the same as the original, and the ultimate embrace by Santa (done well by John Goodman) of Rudolph\'s difference still packs a good lesson.--Andrew Bartlett', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61QR36XNEBL._SY300_.jpg', 4.92, true),

This time, a bored Charlie, looking for a little adventure, reteams with his old pal Itchy (voiced by Dom DeLuise) to retrieve Gabriel\'s Horn after it\'s stolen. Dropping down from Dog Heaven to take on his old nemesis (and killer), Carface (Ernest Borgnine), Charlie falls for a sexy Irish setter (Sheena Easton) and helps a boy caught in a jam. Featuring grand pop songs by the legendary songwriting team of Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil,All Dogs Go to Heaven 2provides kids with a simpler story than Bluth\'s original film, as well as less unsettling violence.

He has taken it to most of the world\'s great opera houses with spectacular success, and it is good to have it in a first-class video recording.The libretto stands out, among operatic treatments of  Faust, for its effort to capture the full, epic scope of Goethe\'s drama, including its moments of unearthly sublimity.

The success of that record pushed Maddox in a more acoustic-oriented direction, and over time she built a style of "Bakersfield bluegrass" that embraced traditional values while adding the bite of electric instruments. By the time she made these recordings in 1980, she\'d perfected that blend; her vocals retained the punch of her early days, but the wilder tendencies had been reined in. Supported here by the stellar but forgottenVern Williams--one of the greatest high-tenor harmonizers in all of bluegrass--plus supple electric guitarist Kraig Hutchens, Maddox runs through bluegrass standards along with revamped chestnuts from her Maddox Brothers days. The final nine cuts stem from a rousing 1982 all-gospel session--three months after her son Donnie\'s death--that drops the electric guitar and features uplifting four-part harmonies.--Marc Greilsamer', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514vHNIZ7EL._SY300_.jpg', 9.49, true),

But the  years have done little to diminish interest in this most iconic of divas. The  debate surrounding the real quality of that voice continues to be fanned by her  devotees and detractors, intermittently reaching fever pitch with the arrival of  another biography or the commercial release of a newly discovered live  recording. Tony Palmer\'s 1987 film portrait, now available on DVD, towers over  the bulk of contributions to the Callas industry because it manages to be both  passionate about its subject and objective about the forces that shaped a great  musical talent and then left it in ruins.Lengthy interviews with colleagues and confidants embrace both Callas\'s  undoubted theatrical genius and the emotional traumas that propelled her  stumbling private life. The scene is set from the moment this documentary\'s  producer, John Ardoin (himself aCallas biographer), declares the  story of Callas the woman to be one of the great tragedies of our time. From  that point, the film forges potent links between the evolution of the diva\'s  artistry through her great performances--Tosca, in particular--and the  defiant soul captured in a considerable archive of media encounters that range  from the intense and contemptuous to the coquettish. This is 90 essential  minutes for anyone interested in the Callas legend.

Moving and dancing from flowing through "stillness" can catalyze and release the emotions of fear, anger, sadness, joy, and peace, according to "urban shaman" and music director Gabrielle Roth. "Flowing"\'s rhythm is carried by a seductive Middle Eastern beat, the crystalline magic of synthesizers, and the heady wailing of guitarist Tim Boyce. "Staccato"\'s angry four/four rhythm rocks to the trap drum work of John Cooksey and the funky deep bass of Yossi Fine. "Chaos"\' six/eight beat tumbles headlong on African drums and heady oracular chants. "Lyrical"\'s easygoing pace features the sparkling guitar work of Tim Boyce, the airy vocalese of Joyce Bowden, and buoyant percussion. Synthesizer master Raphael offers the distilled ecstasy of "Stillness," a breathless alloy of heaven and zen. The clearly-marked tracks offer the trance-dancer an excellent workout through the cycle. Additionally, Roth offers "Body Jazz," an easygoing yet snappy cut to isolate movements of separate body parts, and the intensely driving "Initiation," whose vocal chants and clapping provoke urban tribal feelings. Holding the percussion lines throughout are Mirrors\' mainstays Gordy Ryan and Robert Ansell.

Eventually, country steel guitarists would copy his solos note for note (Hank Williams musician Jimmy Helms is one such example), and today his artistic influence can still be felt amid dobro players, western swing musicians, and even new age instrumentalists.

However throughout the years Khan has shown an interest in jazz as well, and this 60-minute live performance gives the artist a chance to show off her nuanced versatility by covering a handful of old jazz standards. Khan sets the evening\'s mood by allowing her superb band (which is not credited, unfortunately) to warm up and take individual solos on the  instrumental "Dark Secret" before finally making an appearance on stage. Once  she does, it\'s a bit shaky at first. During "Them There Eyes," she sounds  tentative and nervous, but by the time she hits "My Funny Valentine," the singer  hits her stride. Throughout this brief but thoroughly enjoyable set, Khan  consistently picks the right spots to demonstrate that her unmistakable voice  hasn\'t lost a thing over the years. She can still belt them out with the best of  \'em. Even if they\'re not Chaka Khan fans, jazz loyalists will want to see this  show, simply because her band powers the evening; the bass and horn playing  often outshine the singer. Make no mistake: Khan is good here, but her band is better.--Dave McCoy', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518DPY46T4L._SY300_.jpg', 13.48, true),

Recent Grammy Awards and a specialBillboardcitation epitomize the ironies of Mitchell\'s \'80s obscurity: Because she reached her highest profile with the broad success in 1974 ofCourt and Spark, which remains Mitchell\'s lushest, most accessible album, the Canadian musician and painter has found herself comparatively ignored in later years simply because her work ventured into more eclectic amalgams of her already diverse influences. Yet in her forays into world music, jazz, and pop collage, Mitchell has remained a prescient and influential artist.This 1998 concert special sheds welcome light on the work from that post-Sparkquarter century, its 22 songs dominated by the confessional works that have remained Mitchell\'s strong suit. Early favorites like "Big Yellow Taxi" and "Just Like This Train" retain their charm, but it\'s Mitchell\'s more mature pieces such as "Amelia" (fromHejira) and  "Sex Kills"  (fromTurbulent Indigo)  that convey the depth and acuity of her work.  A superb band--including Brian Blade, Mark Isham, Larry Klein, and Greg Leisz--provides a sinewy, sympathetic framework well-suited to the palette of jazz, folk, and pop colors that Mitchell daubs on her songs. Adding further intimacy to the performance is a circular stage design, a small audience, and a welcome lack of "big" production effects; instead, Mitchell indulges her second career as a painter through a pre-show stroll around a gallery of her visual works.Mitchell\'s frail health in the late \'90s, as well as a lifetime of cigarettes, has taken a toll on her voice, which has lost much of its upper register. Yet there\'s also an added richness to her lower range befitting this sharp-eyed survivor\'s art. Old fans will also recognize the flurries of girlish laughter in between-songs patter, while savoring how Mitchell\'s powers as a writer and player (especially on a new, striking electric guitar) have matured as well.--Sam Sutherland', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HBPPBZDCL._SY300_.jpg', 7.75, true),

This was before saxophones and sopranos and string sections began cluttering what had been one of contemporary instrumental music\'s most arresting and thoughtfully energized keyboard-powered sounds. Listen to the commanding-yet-nonaggressive bravura of "After the Sunrise" and "The Rain Must Fall" and recall the days when Yanni infused the "new age" genre with a refreshingly brawny sound, a distinctive style that surged as convincingly as it serenaded. The straightforward approach displayed on this superb sampler is a welcome reminder of the evocative sparks Yanni\'s compositions could strike before he entered his black-velvet and pink-bow phase. Even the disk\'s three bonus tracks, particularly "Flight of Fantasy," are aglow with the keyboardist\'s then-unmistakable style of saintly sexuality.

Describing these efforts as "the most important thing I have ever done," he said they allowed him to "say openly what I have been saying on my knees." As far as this 1998 version is concerned, well, since the subject is sacred music, perhaps some sacred language (i.e., Latin) is appropriate:caveat emptor. Not because this is terrible--it is not--but because it isn\'t Duke Ellington. Oh, it\'s his music all right, but it\'s played by musicians who may be household names in their native Switzerland (the program was filmed in Lugano) but are unlikely to be mentioned in the same breath as Johnny Hodges, Ray Nance, Harry Carney, or any of the other celebrated members of Ellington\'s legendary big band (jazz fans may recognize the few Americans, like trumpeter Jon Faddis, drummer Adam Nussbaum, and featured singer Michele Hendricks, daughter of Lambert, Hendricks & Ross\'s Jon).Perhaps it\'s unfair to expect these players and singers to measure up to Ellington\'s own, because Duke\'s bandwasthe music; they were the tellers of the stories he wrote. Certainly all of the soloists here--especially Faddis, whose superb muted and open horn work on "The Shepherd" and elsewhere recalls the great Cat Anderson\'s--are more than capable. Hendricks and fellow singer Allan Harris are fine too. And the material? It\'s elegant, swinging, soulful, filled with humor and deep spirituality, both worldly and reverent, the voicings and orchestrations inimitably Ellingtonian. But there is something missing--these musicians seem to  be visiting Duke\'s music rather than inhabiting it.--Sam Graham', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Fnt7P6F6L._SY300_.jpg', 12.47, true),

Like Krauss, Morris first made her mark as an instrumental prodigy (in Morris\' case, on banjo) yet eventually made her deepest impression as a singer and bandleader. Like Krauss, Morris has recast bluegrass--previously known for its speed-demon breaks--as a slower, more song-oriented music on a series of superb albums. Morris hasn\'t achieved Krauss\'s commercial breakthrough yet, but it\'s not inconceivable that she could.   You don\'t need any comparisons to Krauss, however, to appreciate the distinction of the title track on Morris\' third album,Mama\'s Hand. This Hazel Dickens song tells the universal story of a teenager somewhat reluctantly leaving a backwater town to seek her fortune elsewhere. Set against a very simple, nicely understated Carter Family-like backing, Morris\'s warbling soprano is way out front. Stripped clean of all the showy embellishments many singers mistake for drama, her plain, open vocal captures both the high hopes of starting a new life and the heartbreak of saying goodbye to her mother. She never whines but projects the strength a young woman needs to leave behind everyone and everything she knows.    Morris\'s three bandmates--Tom Adams on banjo, David McLaughlin on mandolin and guitar, and Marshall Wilborn on upright bass--are all alumni of the Johnson Mountain Boys, the best traditional bluegrass band of the baby-boomer generation. Because the quartet is fiddler-less as well as drummer-less, Morris\'s voice is the only sustaining instrument in the mix and thus it stands out dramatically from the percussive arpeggios around her.--Geoffrey Himes', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pq-zFSEHL._SY300_.jpg', 16.61, true),

Backed by the lapidary if impersonal arrangements of her sizable band, including  ubiquitous session man Waddy Wachtel (Jackson Browne, Keith Richards) on guitar,  Rick Marotta on drums, and mood-setter Jai Winding at keyboards, Nicks\'s dusky,  chanteuse vocals bear down hard on this program\'s nine selections. Hard, but not  always interestingly. Sorely missing is the rare alchemy of a real band like  Mac, in which Nicks\'s irresistible status as grandiloquent white witch and heel- stomping rocker enlivens, and is enlivened by, the reciprocal quirks of fellow  members. In this star-focused setting, Nicks doesn\'t get to dance freely on the  ledges of Lindsey Buckingham\'s maniacal palaces. Her responsibility is to anchor  a more predictable enterprise, and while that certainly doesn\'t dull Nicks\'s  commitment, it obscures her artistry and makes her show look like a self-tribute  at a supper club. Highlights include a driving cover of pal Tom Petty\'s "I Need  to Know," a bluesy "Talk to Me," and a touching "Has Anyone Ever Written Anything for You." A  still photograph of Nicks and Mick Fleetwood (who adds percussion at a couple of  points) that kind of dissolves in and out during "Beauty and the Beast" is  embarrassing, but makes it perfectly clear what that particular tune is about.  Peter Frampton shows up for an encore of "Edge of Seventeen," as do a bunch of  white-winged doves someone releases from the audience, one of which finds refuge  in Nicks\'s palm and decides to stay awhile.

The program pleases on so many levels: slip the disc into the player, hit any track at random, and you\'ll be moved. Take the oh-so-slow, heartfelt groover "Squeeze Me," on which her alto is both breathy and demonstrative and her accompaniments are sly, and which features a winsome solo by bass maestroRay Brown. On another gut-wrenching crawler, "All Night Long," Krall tears you up with her emotive, intimate vocal, interspersing her singing with telling, shimmering piano notes, then delivering a solo full of wry confidences. The succulent title track is a deliciously slow bossa where Krall\'s vocal is partly whispered, as if sung in your ear. More upbeat is the finger-popping "Is You Is or Is You Ain\'t My Baby," where the artist sings with grit and life then solos with an economical drive. Tenor saxophone giantStanley Turrentineadds a trademark saucy improvisation. "I Love Being Here with You" is a romping shuffle where Krall\'s voice hits some notes on the head and stretches others like pulled taffy.

Neither twin is a particularly  remarkable actress, singer, or dancer, but the numbers are sweet enough.  There is an underscored theme of  closeness, loyalty, and thoughtfulness towards friends, which are values anyone  appreciates and welcomes into their home.

The rhythms range from Latin-techno on "Festival de Ritmo" to the light swing of acoustic jazz on "Softly, As in a Morning Sunrise." Weckl is joined by a number of eminent associates, includingMichael Breckerand Eric Marienthal on saxophones.

The music sometimes takes a backseat to Weckl\'s pyrotechnics, but that\'s in keeping with a musician initially inspired byBuddy Rich.

This production is the first  available in DVD. It faces formidable competition from CD and VHS recordings,  but it has its own personality and, taken on its own terms, it is a delight--well cast, carefully worked out in the smallest details of music and staging,  and technically far ahead of its most notable competitors. The only serious  problem is with the orchestra--quite competent after a minute or two warming up  at the beginning, but simply not as sumptuous or idiomatic as the Vienna  Philharmonic.Der Rosenkavalier\'s plot is a complex blend of farce and serious drama.  Young love, social pretension, greed, and unselfishness are part of its subtly  mingled motivations. It requires a carefully integrated interpretation and  receives one in this production, thanks to excellent conducting and stage  direction. Elizabeth Whitehouse gives a touching characterization of the  Marschallin, an aging grande dame who comes to terms with the loss of her youth  and her young lover, Octavian (the velvet-voiced Ildiko Komlosi). Daniel Lewis  Williams has just the right level of boorish pomposity as the aptly named Baron  Ochs (Oxin German).Notable competitors include a1931 recordingof about half the  score with many members of the original cast and a1956 recording, conducted by  Herbert von Karajan with a much-admired performance by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf as  the Marschallin. The Schwarzkopf-Karajan combination (in a later performance)  can be seen in a technically flawed but classicVHS edition.

The idea for the 25-minute video, which is designed to stimulate a baby\'s brain through engaging animation, is based on research that the neurological connections that occur in a baby\'s brain during the first three years of life, are critical to proper brain development. Scientific research aside, babies respond favorably because the film captivates them, combining attention-grabbing images, geometric patterns, facial expressions, and peek-a-boo games with gentle music as well as baby coos and gurgles. The result is a soothing yet stimulating visual feast for infants up to age 2. Simple shapes--circles, stars, hearts, and triangles--slowly make their way across the screen, morphing into familiar objects such as flowers, butterflies, trains, bubbles, and bouncing balls. The video is meant to be an interactive event between parent and child as the baby is cradled, cuddled, and gently bounced to the music while the parent calls out recognizable objects. With or without adult participation, babies will coo, smile, and even "talk" to the images they see as they hear familiar tunes such as "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star."--Lynn Gibson', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4156NWWY94L._SY300_.jpg', 297.7, true),

Whitney, Celine, and Mariah can run circles around her small, sweet voice, but Janet brings a tough, muscular power to her live performances that none of those peers can approach, storming through myriad set and costume changes, and sustaining an aerobic pace through elaborate dance routines. As captured during this Madison Square Garden presentation of her Velvet Rope tour, Janet Jackson is, ahem, very buff indeed, not just in her well-toned physical health, but in her vocal attack.The Velvet Ropetosses up rappers, hard-rock heroism, melting romantic pop, and Jackson\'s own flavor of soft-core erotica, but the show transcends those components in its broad sense of spectacle. The star fronts a formidable battalion of dancers, singers, and musicians to make her points, and while it\'s obvious that the musical performances have been nipped, tucked, and polished to an acceptable sheen, Janet earns her props through sheer willpower.Ranging across Jackson\'s best-known songs from the last decade, the production is noteworthy for its intricate choreography and massive settings, in which the star seeks to match the big-budget sweep of her music videos. The live troupe is formidable, composed of a crack band and a large cast of nimble dancers, and Janet keeps pace with her aerobic presence. We\'ll leave it to social scientists to ponder the significance of the "Rope Burn" sequence, in which an ecstatic male fan is lashed to a chair and gets to watch his favorite sex object pole-dance.

And while 64 may be past the prime of, say, a baseball player or an astronaut (John Glenn might beg to differ), the 80-minute concert offers effortless evidence that McRae was at the absolute top of her game. The setting isn\'t what you\'d call intimate; most jazz musicians would prefer a smoky nightclub to the relatively antiseptic and formal atmosphere of Tokyo\'s Kan-I Hoken Hall. No problem for McRae, who leads her trio (Pat Coil, piano; Bob Bowman, bass; Mark Pulice, drums) through a selection of some 19 tunes, mostly standards like "That Old Black Magic," "What a Little Moonlight Can Do," and Antonio Carlos Jobim\'s "Dindi"; she also accompanies herself on piano on "That Old Devil Called Love" and "As Long as I Live." All of it is classic Carmen. She uses her voice like a horn, improvising almost all the way, hinting at and toying with the melody, growling and soaring, totally at ease with not knowing exactly what\'s coming next. No pyrotechnics here--just a mature jazz artist who could swing like crazy on the uptempo material, caress every nuance from the ballads ("My Old Flame" is especially lovely), and bring both complete respect and a sense of humor to every note she sang. Composer credits would be nice, as would some more bonus DVD features (which include only a selectable song menu and a partial discography), but it\'s the music that matters, and Carmen McRae doesn\'t come any better than this.--Sam Graham', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71DHG279V7L._SY300_.gif', 49.99, true),

Ambrogio in Milan, this Christmas  concert starring Jos&eacute; Carreras with David Gimenez conducting the Arturo  Toscanini Orchestra includes a few sentimental religious favorites, notably  C&eacute;sar Franck\'s "Panis Angelicus," Schubert\'s "Ave Maria" (in which he  gets the words mixed up), the anonymous "Adeste Fideles," "Silent Night" sung in  Italian, and "The Lord\'s Prayer," sung (in English) as an encore and, for some  viewers, probably worth the price of the disc. There are baroque orchestral  selections (a Bach overture, the "Arrival of the Queen of Sheba" from Handel\'sSolomon), and some pop favorites: "The Little Drummer Boy," sung in both  English and Italian, and "White Christmas," sung as an encore in English.Among the more exotic items are an Italian adaptation of a Schubert lullaby  titled "Mille cherubini in coro" ("A thousand Cherubim in chorus") and a setting  of "Panis Angelicus" attributed to J.S. Bach, who would have had serious  theological problems with the text. Most of the time, the performance is  essentially operatic, with lush orchestration and lots of vocal vibrato, whether  the music happens to be folk, pop, or liturgical.

A glitzy Hollywood cast and a big budget did not improve the wonderful 1957 teleplay (or its equally charming 1964 remake) upon which this version is based. This is partly because Brandy, cast in the title role, cannot act. Not helping matters are Whoopi Goldberg as the prince\'s mother and Jason Alexander as his valet. Their shtick wears thin very quickly. However, Paolo Montalban is charismatic as the prince, and Whitney Houston plays a fairy godmother with pizzazz. The production cost millions, and is certainly lavish, but the whole affair feels forced and overdone, reminding one of a prom queen wearing too much makeup. It does deserve credit for a multi-ethnic cast, the addition of two new songs and a hip attitude. However, the 1964 version (the original was not taped) is much sweeter and more romantic.

Its sound betrays the original monaural mix and notable concert PA system glitches, and the video coverage likewise suffers from lapses in focus, color saturation from the stage lights, and questionable camera choices. Why on earth would we recommend it? Because even a flawed Feat show captures one of that decade\'s most mesmerizing live groups, and the set in question offers the first comprehensive visual record of that prowess.In an era noteworthy for live rock\'s vaunted arena ambitions, including the substitution of elaborate production effects and musical bombast for musicianship, Little Feat were riveting exceptions, a supple and accomplished sextet that made their often intricate and subtle music sound deceptively simple and accessible. Mating gutbucket blues, country flourishes, and New Orleans second-line syncopations to colorful (and sometimes surrealistic) songs, this true Hollywood band was often mistaken for a Southern boogie outfit. And, in original leader and principal songwriter Lowell George, Feat had a funny, feisty front man whose striking electric slide guitar playing would influence dozens of other musicians.By the time of this live broadcast from Essen, Germany, George had stepped back to allow a more democratic arrangement, and virtuoso keyboard player Bill Payne and second guitarist Paul Barrere were taking over much of the writing. A shared group style, noteworthy for slippery time signatures, sneaky jazz harmonies, and a nifty mix of street smarts and poeticism, had coalesced in their repertoire, here echoing their brilliant live album,Waiting for Columbus.If you\'re looking for a showcase for DVD\'s technical state of the art, this isn\'t it.

Other cuts, though, such as a beat-smart rerecording of "Vaseline Machine Gun"--from his legendary first album,6- and 12-String Guitar--and the Delta-flamenco fusion of "Dead End," demonstrate the wisdom of the Kottke-Z pairing.

HisQuartet for the End of Time(composed and first performed in a concentration camp) is one of the most powerful and emotionally satisfying pieces of chamber music ever written. Messiaen devised his own rhythmic and harmonic "modes," and his greatest influences were Catholic mysticism and bird song. Is it any wonder that his music created a whole new sound world? It\'s sort of the musical equivalent of those computer-generated pictures where, if you stare hard enough, a 3-D object is revealed. Once your ears adjust to what\'s going on, you&#xB9;re completely mesmerized. The trick is in performing the music properly. Here is a performance that brings the piece fully to life. Individually, the playing is excellent (the cellist and clarinetist, in particular, are exceptional). As a group they come as close as any to fulfilling Messiaen\'s intent: to "bring the listener closer to eternity."  Filmed at a live concert in a beautiful old church with lots of arches and nooks, the camera slowly works its way around the architecture; much the way an audience member might look around as the music transported him or her into another world. As a major bonus, this disc includes Messiaen himself improvising three pieces at the organ of the Trinity Church in Paris. The opportunity of being able to watch a composer of this caliber create music spontaneously is easily worth the price of the disc.--Seth Krimsky', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EAAB272AL._SY300_.jpg', 360.42, true),

Put them together, and you have the first and only release from the Dreadful Snakes.\n\nPat Enright\'s original, "Who\'s That Knocking at My Door," opens the album. His lead vocal, a cross between Jimmie Rodgers and heart singers like Mac Wiseman, strikes the right tone of mounting fear, offset by the band\'s sprightly picking. Jerry Douglas\' killer dobro fills add a touch of winking menace.\n\nThe band displays its formidable instrumental chops on the title cut, a full-speed-ahead, contemporary banjo breakdown from the pen of Bela Fleck. Fiddler Blaine Sprouse, Douglas, and mandolinist Roland White give Fleck a run for his money as they each get a chance in the spotlight.\n\nWith "Story of the Pharisees," bassist Mark Hembree contributes one of the best bluegrass gospel songs of the contemporary era, a pointed critique of -- and warning to -- legalistic, self-righteous Christians. Weighted with low-baritone singers, the sound of the gospel quartet is unusually warm and rich, and Fleck\'s guitar accompaniment is particularly fine.\n\nWith three former Blue Grass Boys -- White, Sprouse, and Hembree -- on board, it\'s no surprise that the Dreadful Snakes gravitate toward the bluegrass songs of Bill Monroe. The best of these are "Travelin\' Down This Lonesome Road," on which Sprouse matches the vocalists\' timbre and feeling to absolute perfection. Even Fleck\'s banjo twangs in sympathy with the desolation expressed in the lyrics. "In Despair" showcases the burnished sound of the Snakes\' vocal trio, and screaming instrumental breaks from Fleck and Roland White.\n\n"Blue Yodel #4" has a galvanic, live feel, as the Snakes surrender to the sheer joy of the music. The fun continues with a swinging, bluesy version of the Louvin Brothers\' "Cash on the Barrelhead." Enright\'s vocal is a delightful mix of irony and despair.', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uu0am2bML._SY300_.jpg', 16.85, true),

To break into the mainstream, the  movement needed a powerful voice of prophetic proportions. This voice emerged  from the collective work of three pioneering friends from Jamaica, Peter Tosh,  Bunny Wailer, and Robert Nesta Marley, who sought to bring about an ideological  revolution through deeply meditative, hypnotic, and spiritual music.Catch a Firewas the Wailers\'  and reggae\'s introduction to the world and turned Bob Marley into a mega-icon of  enormous proportions. It was the first album to remain true to the traditions of  reggae music while having enough elements that were accessible to popular  culture.This documentary,Bob Marley and the Wailers: Catch a Fire, returns to  Dynamic Studios in Kingston, Jamaica, shedding light on the development of the  album, the thought process of Bob, Peter, and Bunny, and the importance of the  music on a song-by-song basis. The story ofCatch a Fireis presented  through interviews with the band members, studio musicians, and former head of  Island Records Chris Blackwell. Throughout are raw studio rehearsal footage, BBC  TV footage, and home movies that include performances of "Concrete Jungle,"  "Slave Driver," "Stir It Up," and "Stop That Train."

"It\'s hard to expect real serious  intentions with a rock concert with millions of kids." Indeed. Most of the  thousands in attendance over the weekend didn\'t know squat, much less care,  about the situation in Tibet. As long as they got to see Rage Against the  Machine hammer home their political fury or A Tribe Called Quest kick out the  jams, everything would be fine. This documentary, which mixes concert footage  with backstage and crowd interviews, political lectures, and archival footage of  Tibet\'s downtrodden history, successfully captures both the good intentions of  the festival organizers and the ignorant audience reception, i.e., kids more  interested in moshing and partying than world peace. As one kids puts it, "I  care, ya know, but short attention span." The same unfortunately can be said of  Pirozek\'s approach to all of this. She directs the film like she has ants in her  pants, and then cuts it together with a blender. If you want the film to catch  live moments by your favorite bands, you\'ll be disappointed. Pirozek rarely  keeps the camera onstage long enough to enjoy the bands. Only Bjork\'s  mesmerizing performance of "Hyper-Ballad" and Sonic Youth\'s "Bull in the  Heather" are played in their entirety; otherwise, bands are interrupted by  interviews, speeches, and random bits of Tibetan history. While it\'s admirable  for the documentary to teach its audience along with entertaining with music,  its approach is halfhearted on both accounts.--Dave McCoy', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516807R6RBL._SY300_.jpg', 18.68, true),

Born legally blind, Schneider underwent many operations as a child but was unable to see more than light and shadow; he had to do all of his schoolwork in Braille. Today he is able to drive a car without use of glasses or contacts, after improving his sight holistically. In this video, Schneider shares his techniques, using movements that originate in two main sources: the techniques of ophthalmologist William Bates and Tibetan yoga.To begin, Schneider instructs you to remove your contacts or glasses (how he expects you to see the screen clearly enough to follow the exercises is not explained). Then he moves on to "palming," a vision-improving exercise. The instruction is thorough, including directions on how to breathe, and the movements are simple and relaxing. The second segment is "Testing Your Vision," in which you\'re told to make your own eye chart to graph your improvement. "Stimulating Your Peripheral Vision" is next, and it requires three pieces of black construction paper and tape to help you balance the use of both eyes together. "Outdoor Exercises" explains why older people have more vision difficulties and shows how to improve this problem. The final exercises--"Sunning," "Skying," and "Long Swing"--help you to adapt to bright lights.Schneider is an earnest instructor, who obviously believes strongly in his methods. If you\'re looking for a natural way to improve your eyesight,Yoga for Your Eyesis the place to begin.

This can lead to a blink-and-you-missed-it feel that can be easily remedied with the rewind button. The lesson is tightly organized but uses quick cuts and humor to keep students interested. For instance, when an actor likens fear of public speaking to "an energetic tap dancer who suddenly appears in your stomach to dance the first two acts ofShowboat," a miniature man appears onscreen to do a jig against the background of a giant tummy. If you\'ve taken a course in public speaking, none of this should be new; but it\'ll serve nicely as a refresher for those who have studied the subject and an introduction to those who haven\'t.--Kimberly Heinrichs', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51402GAX70L._SY300_.jpg', 4.95, true),

The latter group will know that a "funny day" means the lovable British imports are in for splattering Tubby custard and flying Tubby toast, all of which is left to everyone\'s favorite wet-dry vacuum, the Noo-noo, to tidy up.  In fact, the theme of this video, the fifth in the series, is messes (parents might cringe at the two live sequences, especially one involving hand-foot-body painting). The Teletubbies have taken more than their share of criticism for their otherworldly appearance, their simplistic actions and language, and their mind-numbing repetition. There is, however, no question that children adore these creatures and interact with and learn from them.Teletubbiesmight even be the first television program your child responds to.  Unlike some children\'s TV available on video, eachTeletubbiesvideo is not merely two half-hour episodes tossed onto a videotape, but a one-hour unified whole. (Also, the live sequences are not repeated, which will make parents very grateful.)  As a result, the videos have a different feel from the episodes, but the drawback is that it\'s harder to convince a child that a half-hour of TV really is enough when Laa-Laa hasn\'t yet said bye-bye.Funny Dayalso offers unusually close camera shots--want to see what Tubby custardreallylooks like?--and just wait till you see the Noo-noo tidy up the beds.

You\'re not being tested, she constantly reminds you in case you do not succeed at the exercises; she\'s just offering ways for you to hone your psychic powers. Eight types of psychic abilities exist, and Burns works through them, beginning with the "preliminaries," which you should do first to reduce stress and tension. Following, the topics covered are gut feelings, sensing versus feeling, clairvoyance, auras, psychic healing, mediumship, and telepathy. Despite Burns\'s gentle manner, the computer-generated backgrounds, talking head format, and constant low-volume New Age music are distracting. Yet the visuals are not the point of this video; the refinement of your psychic capabilities is what\'s important here.

As with each of their tours since the early \'80s, the quartet, augmented by a discreet auxiliary of backup musicians, gives the fans new eye candy while dishing up a familiar set list spiked with Mick Jagger\'s lip-smacking vocals and Keith Richards\'s signature guitar riffs. The visual twists are at once spectacular and conservative: a cyclopean main stage design with massive pillars (presumably the Babylonian connection), a vast oval video screen (shades of Big Brother), and a hydraulic bridge enabling a midconcert sortie into the audience, with the Stones playing a more stripped-down, intimate set on a small satellite stage.That huge physical setting doubtless made the live shows eye-filling rock spectacles, but the video crew necessarily accepts the limitations of the small screen, focusing more on close-ups of the band, rapid cuts, and racing, hand-held tracking shots to convey excitement while keeping the viewer close to the action. The evening\'s repertoire sticks to the band\'s most familiar hits, and if the Glimmer Twins occasionally slip their masks to let the routine show, the real wonder is how effectively they keep the playing focused. During the first half of the program, the band\'s newest songs (especially "Saint of Me" and "Out of Control") elicit conspicuously higher energy from the band, if not the audience. But just as the show seems doomed to a certain anomie, the escape onto the smaller, no-frills stage pumps up players and crowd alike, particularly when they launch into "Like a Rolling Stone," a cover that winds up sounding like a great idea too long deferred.--Sam Sutherland', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EX9M5KNHL._SY300_.jpg', 8.64, true),

He was smart enough, however, to recognize the contradictions of performing rootsy, leftist "people\'s music" for the mostly middle-aged, highly educated, upper-middle-class audience of modern singer-songwriter folk music. He tried to bust out of that bind with his 1994 album,Between the Eclipse, which set his songs in electrified folk-rock arrangements played by the likes of Nanci Griffith guitarist Pete Kennedy, Bruce Hornsby saxophonist Bobby Read and Mary Chapin Carpenter singer Jon Carroll. Now McCutcheon has followed up that effort withNothing To Lose, a similar project with the same musicians.The irony, of course, is that this old-fashioned, refined brand of roots-rock, with its echoes of Hornsby, Griffith and Bruce Springsteen, merely attracts a slightly larger version of the same audience drawn to singer-songwriter folk.

Nevertheless, Davis\'s slow movement is broad, with a beautifully sculpted first theme and the final Allegro has plenty of power. The 1976 Mendelssohn "Italian" bristles with liveliness and is one of the better versions on disc. Superior playing by the Boston Symphony, evident in the delicious solo winds, especially in the Presto finale, the full, warm strings, and refined ensemble.

It follows the Nova Scotian songstress from her days as a sentimental, round-faced youth  through her breakthrough success onFumbling Towards Ecstasyto the  explosion of fame, thanks to Lilith Fair and the multiplatinum sales ofSurfacing.  The earliest of the collection clearly displays hints of great things to come, although viewing the  pre-glory-days videos, half of which are alternating takes on Canadian and U.S. versions, is akin to  checking out your coolest friend\'s high-school yearbook. Expecting the brilliance to which you are  accustomed ("Building a Mystery,"  "Adia"), you instead learn that  McLachlan herself struggled through some decidedly uncool artistic pretensions prior to connecting  her vision to her work. A song from her 1988 albumTouch, "Vox," is rendered post-new-wave cheesy  (Canadian version) and aimless (U.S. version), andSolace\'s "The Path of Thorns (Terms)" features a  nude McLachlan crooning in the shared space of a modern ballet couple. Despite a misguided turn  at "Possession" (a nefarious mess of  religious imagery), it is McLachlan who successfully guides the straight-ahead black and white  performance of "Ben\'s Song" and also that of the Celtic-inspired "Drawn to the Rhythm," evokingLoreena McKennitt\'s smash hit "The Mummer\'s Dance." Yet it is the  U.S. version of "Possession" on which we begin to see McLachlan as we have come to know her--dressed down, picking hard, and singing with eyes wide open. Fully connected to each other and  the material, McLachlan and her band are filmed home-movie style in an otherwise empty theater  space. As proven by McLachlan\'s magical turn on theSurfacingvideos, those seats  wouldn\'t stay vacant for long.--Paige La Grone', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31BYGCQHD0L.jpg', 10.78, true),

Luderin supplied the band with hillbilly songs he\'d learned in Texas, while Duhon grew up immersed in French music. Recorded midcareer, in 1963 and 1965, this album\'s 26 tracks capture the band in fine, fun form. The songs often combine English and French verses and walk a fine line between Cajun and Western swing rhythms.

Sung in French by the group\'s leader, Michael Doucet, the songs on this collection effectively show Beausoleil\'s more traditional side.--Robert Baird', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61pv6tzykWL._SY300_.jpg', 16.4, true),

Even after much of the music retreated to safer, less partisan themes, the right crusade has been able to mobilize artists to raise funds and awareness, and Amnesty International has proven among the most reliable of these missions: fromThe Secret Policeman\'s Ballshows produced in England, to more recent tour packages helmed by \'80s superstars such as Peter Gabriel and U2, the human rights organization has inspired bold concerts.This production, mounted December&nbsp;10, 1998, commemorates the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a milestone underscored with between-songs informational segments that succinctly promote the beneficiary\'s themes of tolerance and social responsibility. Filmed and live cameos mix celebrities with sage comments from the Dalai Lama (whose impish "thumbs up" to the crowd elevates the entire affair) and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. An underlying fervor also sparks much of the music, particularly from Peter Gabriel, Youssou N\'Dour, Tracy Chapman, and a solo Bruce Springsteen, whose songs all allude to the human rights agenda. Alanis Morissette\'s brief set likewise takes on a spiritual glow consistent with both her second solo album and the context at hand, while jubilant sets from Kassav and the Asian Dub Foundation serve as potent multicultural celebrations.The show isn\'t without its rough spots:  an opening rendition of Bob Marley\'s "Get Up, Stand Up" by Chapman, Gabriel, N\'Dour, and Springsteen is more awkward than transcendent (especially in Springsteen\'s wooden delivery), and Gabriel\'s subsequent duet with N\'Dour starts out shakily. Two Led Zeppelin classics from Jimmy Page and Robert Plant incite Zep fans but seem nearly irrelevant here, as does Shania Twain\'s slick but shallow stint. But Radiohead\'s three-song set restores the two-hour concert\'s generally thoughtful and thought-provoking substance.--Sam Sutherland', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RP1CQE9EL._SY300_.jpg', 43.22, true),

Although this DVD was mastered from a ragged print (with plenty of scratches evident throughout), this is actually the better of the two Yes discs available (the other--Live in Philadelphia--has an even murkier transfer from videotape), with marginally better sound quality and a 75-minute performance that finds the band at the height of their "early years" popularity. The lineup is the same as that of the 1979 performance in Philadelphia (Jon Anderson, Steve Howe, Chris Squire, Alan White, Rick Wakeman), but this concert is by a much younger, much more ambitious band that was still forging its formidable prog-rock identity. As a result this is the more valuable of the two Yes performances on DVD--a tighter, sharper, more satisfying look at the band at the peak of their creativity. It\'s also worth noting that they allowed room for solo improvisations (such as Howe\'s playful rendition of "The Clap" and Wakeman\'s excerpts from "The Six Wives of Henry VIII"), but as a group they remained intimately faithful to their studio recordings. And although even die-hard fans will grumble about the film\'s murky quality (which DVD can do nothing to improve), camera access was adequate for this show and each member of the band is given adequate screen time to demonstrate his instrumental virtuosity--particularly Howe, whose guitar work here is nothing short of amazing. While it\'s unfortunate that both DVDs featuring live Yes music leave much to be desired, this disc is definitely worth owning if you\'ve ever wanted to see the giants of \'70s prog-rock at the top of their game.--Jeff Shannon', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41F60QPlFHL._SY300_.jpg', 9.73, true),

Reed got his start in Greenwich Village, and  indeed this show has a strong air of a hero\'s return. The former Velvet  Underground frontman greets the crowd with a tidy-but-tough "Sweet Jane,"  then smoothly skips through his then-catalogue of pre- and post-solo career records. "I\'m Waiting for the Man" takes us back to the well, while "Wild  Side," "Don\'t Talk to Me About Work," "Waves of Fear," and a stunning version  of "Kill Your Sons" reflects something of the scope of Reed\'s development. A  blistering "White Light/White Heat" reminds one of the Velvets\' magnificent sting, and the show closes out with an epic take on "Rock \'n\' Roll." Reed is  backed by a spare ensemble, including the outstanding Robert Quine on  guitar, Fred Maher on drums, and Fernando Saunders on bass.

It\'s possibly the most complex and eclectic record of Leo Kottke\'s career. Produced by singer and longtime Kottke fan Rickie Lee Jones, and featuring appearances by Van Dyke Parks on accordion, Dean Parks on guitar, and Syd Straw on vocals, PECULIAROSO is pop- and jazz-oriented, but with Kottke\'s usual growly vocals and folk/blues acoustic and electric guitar playing.The arrangements are less slick and rockier than on his late-\'80s new age-oriented albums.

Released in March of that year, THE JOSHUA TREE became U2\'s first number-one album and won a Grammy Award for Album of the Year. The record\'s crossover appeal stems from its emotional exploration of universal topics such as love (&#34;With or Without You&#34;), death (&#34;One Tree Hill&#34;), and spiritual longing (&#34;I Still Haven\'t Found What I\'m Looking For&#34;) without sacrificing any of the trademark social consciousness of the band\'s earlier albums (&#34;Bullet the Blue Sky,&#34; &#34;Mothers of the Disappeared&#34;). This episode of the CLASSIC ALBUMS series details the making of U2\'s chart-topping album through interviews with band members, archival film footage, and live performances.

Halfway through its chart life, the song, a big adult contemporary hit (and a big, classic Carey-styled ballad) which managed to top the pop charts for one week (without even making Top Ten airplay), was remixed into "My All/Stay Awhile" and issued as a separate maxi-single. There was already one maxi-single on the market for "My All." The new version, however, is almost a completely different song. Carey enlisted Jermaine Dupri to transform the ballad into a hip-hop summer jam, and featured then-hot rappers Lord Tariq and Peter Gunz lending their rhyming skills. As is typically the case with Dupri songs, its breezy, bouncy, funky, and light. The maxi-single contains both a version with rap and one without. There are also two good but somewhat interchangeable club/house mixes of the original "My All," courtesy of David Morales. Finally, there is a fantastic remix of the album track "The Roof." That song was a minor hit in Europe, and for this single, Morales turned it into a funky, groovy club jam with a slammin\' bassline and gangly guitars to excellent effect. So in essence, this unusual single is comprised of a totally new, retitled version of "My All," two dance mixes of the song, and one great remix of "The Roof."', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/11VRGZ1DAZL.jpg', 3.59, true),

His new one, &quot;Strange Things Happening,&quot; comes closer to the unpredictable excitement of LaBeef\'s live shows than anything he\'s ever done in a studio.Coproduced by music historian Peter Guralnick and his brother Jake, &quot;Strange Things Happening&quot; jumps all over the musical map--from Wynn Stewart\'s Bakersfield-sound &quot;Playboy&quot; to Johnny Cash\'s rockabilly &quot;You\'re My Baby,&quot; from Ernest Tubb\'s self-described &quot;Waltz Across Texas&quot; to Sister Rosetta Tharpe\'s gospelshout title tune. Believe it or not, that\'s a typical set list for LaBeef, who reportedly knows more than 6,000 songs from all genres.The common denominator in every performance is LaBeef himself, never subtle but always enthusiastic as he tries to reconcile his lusty taste for the blues and his romantic affection for country in his deep, bellowing baritone and his let-her-rip approach to the guitar.

There\'s just something magical about klezmer: it\'s all about energy and swing, but it\'s also (almost always) tinged with sadness. Which brings us to Naftule Brandwein. Brandwein was unique back in the \'20s and \'30s (he\'d be unique now, too), a legendary self-promoter, drinker, gambler, but--most of all--player. Unlike that of Dave Tarras, the delicate and couth klezmer artist we all remember, Brandwein\'s music is loud and sweeping; he\'s a powerhouse on the clarinet.

Ms. Frizzle\'s class is taking part in a model-airplane contest to explore the principles of aerodynamics, when Mrs. Frizzle shrinks herself and a few class members so that they can fly their plane themselves. When the remote control breaks, the kids in the airplane must learn to fly it. Those remaining on the ground must somehow turn the Magic Schoolbus into an airplane so they can rescue their classmates. Through trial and error, the whole class discovers that in order to fly, an object needs to have wings, moving air, power, and steering. They discover firsthand how birds\' wings act as propellers, and how birds and planes steer with rudders and flaps. Finally, with some help from an eagle, they learn to take off, fly, and land. Kids will learn about aerodynamics by observing what works and what doesn\'t as the characters try to stay aloft.

Gleason asks Count Basie the name of the first piece that  the pianist-bandleader and his small group played. "I don\'t know," says Basie  with a laugh. He\'s not being flip. "I Don\'t Know," as it eventually became  known, is, like most of the other music Basie and company play here, nothing  more or less than a blues jam, improvised on the spot. The "casual" label has  never been more appropriate, as this 1968 performance finds Basie at his most  relaxed. He smokes a lot. He talks a lot: about the influence of Duke Ellington  and such legendary pianists as Fats Waller, Pete Johnson, and Meade Lux Lewis;  about the genesis of "One O\'Clock Jump," the Basie band\'s signature tune; and  about his own playing style, which he self-effacingly calls "dated." And, best  of all, he plays a lot, accompanied by the superb rhythm section of Sonny Payne  on drums, Norman Keenan on bass, and the redoubtable Freddie Green on guitar. "I  never get tired of playing the blues," Basie tells Gleason, and in the hands of  these pros, you\'ll never get tired of listening to it. Basie\'s blues are  inimitable: effortlessly swinging, completely cool, at once laconic and driving,  danceable, humorous, just unmistakably right, with the rhythm players always on  the beat and Basie himself the master of what not to play. This is great stuff,  and highly recommended.--Sam GrahamDizzy GillespieJohn Birks "Dizzy" Gillespie--trumpeter, bandleader, entertainer--was 43 and  still at the peak of his powers when he appeared with his quintet on Ralph J.  Gleason\'s performance-interview TV program,Jazz Casual, in early 1961.  And while his style had become somewhat cooler since the days when he and  Charlie Parker led jazz\'s bebop revolution, this four-song set is as  identifiably Dizzy as his trademark up-tilted horn and ballooning cheeks. The  tunes, from Benny Golson\'s mid-tempo "Blues After Dark" to Dizzy\'s own  "Lorraine" (with an exotic, sinuous melody reminiscent of his more famous "Night  in Tunisia"), are invariably swinging, with fine solo turns by Gillespie,  saxophonist-flutist Leo Wright, and a pianist named Lalo Schifrin. That\'s the  same Lalo Schifrin who within a few short years would achieve pop music  immortality by composing theMission: Impossibletheme.--Sam  GrahamJohn ColtraneIt might not seem like much: 30 minutes, three tunes, four musicians on a bare- bones soundstage. But this is John Coltrane, and any opportunity to see the  legendary saxophonist at work is something to be savored. That\'s especially true  with this January 1964 television performance. Some five years after his  membership in Miles Davis\'s immortalKind of Bluegroup, he was well  past playing the usual standards and ballads; at the same time, he had yet to  explore the outer reaches of the avant-garde. Joined here by pianist McCoy  Tyner, bassist Jimmy Garrison, and drummer Elvin Jones--the classic Coltrane  quartet, and undoubtedly one of the most important and influential groups in  jazz history--he works his way through three numbers that were familiar  components of the Coltrane repertoire: Mongo Santamaria\'s "Afro Blue," which  finds Trane on soprano sax and features a typically dynamic Tyner solo;  "Alabama," a Coltrane original with a brooding, droning intro and conclusion  sandwiched around the middle section\'s slow, swinging groove; and "Impressions,"  the modal touchstone, which at nearly 14 minutes long gives all four musicians  plenty of room to stretch out.Playing the tenor horn here, Coltrane is typically restless and searching,  volcanic and commanding. It\'s not necessarily pretty, especially when he is  backed only by Jones\'s angry, explosive polyrhythms, but the power is  undeniable. The fact that Coltrane says nothing (all otherJazz Casualguests were interviewed by host Ralph J. Gleason) is immaterial; what could he  say with his voice that he hadn\'t already said with his horn?--Sam  Graham', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51W3850DFBL._SY300_.jpg', 129.99, true),

In the U.S., Bocelli\'s critical response has been confined to fusillades of scorn from classical and opera writers, but the bulletproof superstar is better understood in the context of Europe\'s more established tradition of pop-classical fusions. Ironically, fans abroad are less prickly than stateside arbiters about the need for a discreet wall between high (classical) art and low (pop) kitsch, which Bocelli cheerfully ignores with his mix of operatic chestnuts, soft pop, and traditional Italian songs.Indeed, despite interview segments in which he proclaims his love of opera or proudly recalls an apprenticeship to operatic veteran Franco Corelli, Bocelli comes across as more fan than virtuoso.  But if his voice can prompt technical cavils from hard-core opera buffs, the blind singer\'s emotional directness and relative lack of onstage preening explain much of his populist appeal. Featured songs include warhorse arias, leading off with the "Louie, Louie" of tenor showpieces,Turandot\'s "Nessun Dorma," and duets with gruff Italian pop-rocker Zucchero and sopranos Nuccia Focile and Sarah Brightman (who buddies up for the tear-jerking closer, "Time to Say Goodbye").Even with the marquee bonus of those guests, however,A Night in Tuscanygets its biggest boost from the seductive Italian countryside, prominently featured in between-song segments, and in the romantic concert setting, Pisa\'s Piazza dei Cavalieri.--Sam Sutherland', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31MATR17HPL.jpg', 0.96, true),

It also evokes reactions that are especially intense even for Wagnerians.  The sense of simultaneous attraction-repulsion first experienced byNietzschegenerates some of the creative tension in this controversial 1982 film by Hans-J&#xFC;rgen Syberberg, a member of Germany\'s postwar "neues Kino" generation of directors."Syberberg\'sParsifal" is exactly that: it isnotto be approached as a video presentation of an opera but as a full-scale film in its own right. The director\'s concern with the claims of the romantic and "irrational" in Germany\'s cultural heritage, demonized as an aftermath of the Third Reich, is here at its apex.  An astonishingly intricate profusion of imagery saturates the film--as props, cluttering objects, costumes, part of the set, or visuals projected onto the background--with the resonance of a long, disturbing dream. Striking visuals from the opera\'s own symbolic world are set alongside a veritable parade of iconography from Europe\'s cultural history, while the action of the opera is seen to take place within and around an enormous replica of Wagner\'s death mask as backdrop. Conceptually the intention is to counter Wagner\'s "narcotic" spell with Brechtian distance or with aWalter Benjamin-like slant on the artifacts of culture.For all of the radicalism of his imagery, Syberberg hews surprisingly close to more traditional acting styles here, drawing on a "presentational" approach of gesture, the stylization of early film, and intimate reaction shots. The music was actually recorded separately as a soundtrack, to which the actors (mostly a separate cast) lip-synch their performances. Conductor Armin Jordan--a sensitive but never self-indulgent Wagnerian--also actually performs the role of Amfortas, and the distinguished actress Edith Clever is a special asset for her mesmerizing, expressive Kundry, making the role into the opera\'s psychological epicenter. At the point of the resisted kiss in Act II, in a Jungian split, Parsifal becomes portrayed by a woman (still mouthing the mellifluous tenor exclamations of Reiner Goldberg). Syberberg wallows in contradictory currents and obscure symbolism that sometimes reinforces what he seems to want to take apart. Yet he has also succeeded in locating the work somewhere in a unique space between fetishized ritual and purely aesthetic experience. The DVD transfer is somewhat grainy in resolution, while the soundtrack has a noticeable persistent hiss.  Jordin\'s relatively fleet pacing allows for much texture and offers a fine enough performance, though not a top choice on musical terms alone.--Thomas May', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wzwlXhpmL._SY300_.jpg', 47.69, true),

It also helps that Wilson has matured into a terrific songwriter, able to come up with witty wordplay and catchy melodies, much like such heroes as Willie Dixon, Rockin\' Sidney, and David Porter. Wilson co-wrote seven of the 12 songs onRoll the Dice, and comes up with such memorable aphorisms as &quot;How could something so cold come from something so hot?&quot; and &quot;Life is a \'59 Cadillac; I\'m looking forward to looking back,&quot; and such compelling rhythm/melody combinations as the zydeco-flavored &quot;Do As I Say,&quot; the Slim Harpo feel of &quot;Takin\' It Too Easy,&quot; or the Muddy Waters stomp of the title track.

Combine a fabulous performance of these  symphonies (byBarry Wordsworth and the Capella Istropolitana) with a spectacular visual tour of an Italian  monastery and an Austrian city, and you\'ve got a Naxos masterpiece. To the  strains of Symphony No. 40 in G Minor, viewers tour the Neustift Monastery in  Southern Tyrol, Italy. Breathtaking views of the outer walls, halls,  immensely ornate chapel, and extensive library abound. The photography  is crystal clear, the lighting superb, and the pace and path ideal.  Missing completely are the bustling, noisy crowds so frequently  encountered in real-life travel. Symphony No. 28 ushers in a change  of scenery, this time a look at the Austrian Tyrol\'s capital city, Innsbruck. From  the spectacular vista of the city landscape to an in-depth look at some of  the city\'s finest architecture, this is again a journey you won\'t want to  miss. Finally, overtures fromIl re pastore,Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail, andLa clemenza di Titoare paired with contemplative views of ducks at a pond\'s edge and the ornate interiors and exteriors of  several Austrian churches.DVD specifics include a choice of DTS 6 channel Surround Sound, Dolby  Digital Surround Sound, and Dolby Digital Stereo 2.0.

The rigid rhythmic patterns of bluegrass picking were softened and complex scales were introduced, allowing the soloists more flexibility in how they improvised. Earlier bands such as the Seldom Scene and the Country Gentlemen had laid the seeds of progressive bluegrass by adding material from other styles.

The  story, the ironically moralizing attitudes, and many musical and verbal details  are inspired by the 18th century. But it is modern in rhythm and harmony and in  its psychology--Freudianism and existentialism in a powdered wig. Each  production must find its own balance between these polarities, and this crisp,  stylish treatment, taped at the Salzburg Festival in 1996, leans heavily toward  modernity. The Faustian story of ne\'er-do-well Tom Rakewell is told in symbols  from its beginning (when he succumbs instantly to the temptations of the  diabolical Nick Shadow) to the final mad scene. The props include a small,  earthbound airplane, signifying Tom\'s flights of fancy, and some supernumeraries  wearing ape costumes and capering about, symbolizing perhaps his obsessions. The  costumes are modern: Tom in a T-shirt, Anne Trulove (his fianc&eacute;e) in a  dress so simple it looks like a slip, Nick in a mafia-style pinstripe suit.  Designer Jorg Immendorff, a prominent German painter, is ingenious and self-indulgent in his staging. He portrays Tom as an artist not unlike himself. But  if ever an opera had its visual elements clearly prescribed, it isThe Rake\'s  Progress--inspired by a set ofengravings by William Hogarththat  have no resemblance to Immendorff\'s staging.There have been first-class productions that respected Hogarth\'s vision. One of  them is sure to find its way to home video eventually, and those who are upset  by visual tampering with an opera\'s original concept might want to wait. But the  Salzburg audience applauds it thoroughly in this production. Stravinsky\'s music  is well handled. Jerry Hadley brings both pathos and humor to the title role,  Dawn Upshaw puts a lot of personality into the rather bland, goody-goody role of  Anne, and they have an expert supporting cast.--Joe McLellan', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514Z2T29Z5L._SY300_.jpg', 27.98, true),

"Oh yes," said a friend, "that\'s the  good one where everybody is the right age." The youth and freshness of the  singers are, in fact, major assets in this production.

Solid arguments can  be made for the staging of theMetropolitan Opera productionor the vocal quality of theSan Francisco production, but the Australian Opera offers the closest identification of  performers with the characters they represent. The effect is usually touching,  sometimes downright electrifying.For this production, the story is moved up to Paris in the 1950s.

Flat-picking master Clarence White deserves the lion\'s share of credit: all of 19 years old, White revolutionized bluegrass guitar with an exciting, blues-drenched, rhythmically unrestrained, tasteful, and cohesive technique.Doc Watsonhad only recently been "discovered," but Watson\'s open-string, banjo-derived style, which allowed guitarists to handle speedy fiddle licks, provided the final piece to White\'s puzzle. White\'s work on "Nine Pound Hammer," "Billy in the Lowground," and "Sally Goodin" is astonishing, as is his interplay throughout with brother Roland\'s mandolin. The familiar melodies range from traditional fiddle tunes to old-time folk toBob Wills. Pickers fromTony RicetoJerry Garciaacknowledge their debt to Clarence White, a debt they began accruing with this landmark release.--Marc Greilsamer', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61uGCko8bAL._SX300_.jpg', 11.69, true),

In  1982 John Mayall reunited the top members from several versions of his outfit,  The Bluesbreakers, and hit the road. Bassist John McVie (later of Fleetwood Mac)  represented the early \'60s line-up, while Collin Allen and the great Mick Taylor  (of Rolling Stones fame) came from the late \'60s reincarnation. This DVD  captures a show at the Capitol Theater in New Jersey, where Mayall and the  Bluesbreakers, for one night, played with the heroes who inspired them. In a  style much likeThe Last Waltz,the band plays one of their numbers  (among them "The Dark Side of Midnight," "Room to Move," and "My Time After  Awhile") and then are joined by blues legends. Fiery guitarist Albert King rips  through "Why Are You So Mean to Me?" and his classic "Born Under a Bad Sign,"  before melting the audience with "They Call It Stormy Monday." The impeccably  dressed duo of Junior Wells and Buddy Guy offer up "Messin\' with the Kid," and  "Don\'t Start Me Talkin\'." Perhaps the high points, however, belong to the  ladies. A saucy Etta James grinds her way through "Baby, What You Want Me to  Do," while 80-year-old legend Sippie Wallace demonstrates that she\'s not too old  to down a beer and blast out the blues with "Shorty George." Everyone takes the  stage for a massive "C.C. Rider" jam at the conclusion, topping off an excellent  DVD that will stun any blues lover.--Dave McCoy', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RT8KRTVAL._SY300_.jpg', 60.98, true),

Pozo and his dancers ably demonstrate the lindy, jitterbug, polka, fox trot, mambo, cha-cha, and waltz (as well as basic steps, such as the box step, leading up to these).

Mozart called it a "dramma giocoso," which might be translated as "serious comedy," and in fact it is tragic and comic at the same time--climaxing with a spectacular final scene in which the libertine hero (hero? let\'s say "central character") is dragged alive down to hell amid blood-curdling screams. Mozart treated this as a happy ending, and the punishment is richly earned by the rape, murder, and seduction that lead up to it, but at the same time Giovanni has a charm (most clearly displayed in the duet "La ci darem") that makes it easy to believe in his amorous conquests (which are brilliantly detailed in his servant Leporello\'s "catalogue aria").Don Giovannican be interpreted in many ways; the first DVD recording is a solid, middle-of-the-road interpretation, handsomely staged and photographed, generally well conducted and sung (though Thomas Allen has rough spots in his serenade), and acted capably if not brilliantly.

Incorporating footage from John and Yoko\'s original filmImagine(clips of which were previously included in the 1988 documentaryImagine: John Lennon),Gimme Some Truthpresents Lennon, Ono, coproducer Phil Spector, and a host of gifted musicians in a fluid context of conflict, community, and craftsmanship. Bearing witness to every stage of the recording process, this 63-minute documentary succeeds as a visual diary, a study of familiar music in its infancy, and a revealing portrait of the then-30-year-old Lennon--from witty clown to confrontational perfectionist--at the peak of his post-Fab Four inspiration.The film\'s horizons expand with a casual montage of Lennon\'s celebrity  lifestyle, including New York party footage (by film theorist Jonas Mekas) featuring such guests as Miles Davis, Andy Warhol, and Jack Nicholson. Excerpts of a 1971 BBC interview reveal John and Yoko at their most thoughtful, discussing socio-sexual issues that remain compellingly relevant (and the entire 35-minute interview is included on the DVD edition). But the true value ofGimme Some Truthremains in the creation of music at the Lennons\' estate at Tittenhurst Park, Ascot, England. The ballad "Imagine" is followed from rawness to completion, and the track-by-track progress is highlighted by "Jealous Guy" (after which Lennon playfully compliments Spector\'s studio wizardry), and especially "Gimme Some Truth," which alternates between full mix and isolated vocal track. With George Harrison on guitar, Lennon freely admits that "How Do You Sleep?" is a deliberately "nasty" criticism of Paul McCartney, but this remarkable film never dwells on negatives. A precious record of John Lennon\'s time on earth,Gimme Some Truthis as honest as it is entertaining. And while purists may object to the DVD\'s remastered sound--which was carefully remixed for Dolby Digital 5.1-channel stereo at Abbey Road studios--few would deny that this film is an important and illuminating document that any John Lennon fan will cherish.--Jeff Shannon', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NDM0XEPTL._SY300_.jpg', 11.81, true),

Backed by  an outstanding band that takes a respectful but nimble approach to his classic  arrangements on "You\'ve Really Got a Hold on Me," "The Tracks of My Tears," and  "I Second That Emotion," Robinson builds a majestic vocal bridge between gospel- flavored funk glory and delicate orchestral constructions. In no time, we\'re in  his pocket. "Ooh Baby Baby" comes as a wave of masculine remorse couched in  slow-dance splendor: adult experience in youthful form, the genius of Motown. "I  Want a Love I Can See" and "More Than You Know" lead us to the peak of  Robinson\'s gorgeous expression, earning him the right to play directly to the  ladies in the audience with the touching corn of "I Love Your Face." The final  performances, "Just to See Her" and "Going to a Go Go," take us from the wistful  to the epic, the true scale of Robinson\'s brilliance.--Tom Keogh', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515K5C24W1L._SY300_.jpg', 11.46, true),

Except that Amos\'s particular cult long ago reached mass popularity on both sides of the Atlantic, a commercial success borne out by the length and scale of this anthology, which collects all of her music videos to date. For her fans, of course, the package is a commercial slam dunk and instant hit, but even nonbelievers may find themselves mesmerized by these consistently inventive, beautifully shot miniatures.Like her predecessor, British singer-songwriter Kate Bush, Amos suggests a steely waif: her petite beauty and tremulous songs project a fragility that her artistic nerve and lyric provocations belie. However ethereal her image, Amos brings intense focus to her evident love affair with the camera; pale blue eyes, paler skin, and a nimbus of crimson hair make her a pre-Raphaelite poster girl, but she attacks her close-ups with a directness that anchors most of these clips.  It\'s enough to make you forget the frequent obscurity of those lyrics, which her fans pore over like Holy Writ.Amos also succeeds in building a visual style as coherent as her lyrics aren\'t.  Although a committee of different directors and cinematographers appears in the credits, the artist has achieved a consistency in the use of simple but striking compositions (often using stark black or white backdrops and cut-out vignettes as framing devices), evocative special effects, and superb cinematography.--Sam Sutherland', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZGFfoQKUL._SY300_.jpg', 4.25, true),

And No One Else Wanted to Play set the tone for SNFU\'s career on several levels. While many hardcore bands of the period dealt strictly in anger and rebellion, SNFU meshed these elements with a wry sense of humor and warped but goofy subject matter. Songs like "Cannibal Caf " and "She\'s Not on the Menu reveal Mr. Chi Pig\'s penchant for dark humor and witty wordplay. While a strong current of humor runs throughout this as well as their later releases, SNFU is not a novelty act, and their debut aptly establishes this fact. Classic hardcore bile surfaces on several songs throughout. "Seeing Life Through the Bottom of a Bottle" and "Money Matters" revel in traditional punk-rock themes of angst and disenfranchisement from mainstream society. These ideas may seem a bit overplayed today, but SNFU was at the forefront of the genre and set the standards that persisted through the hardcore scene of the \'80s and \'90s. The production of And No One Else Wanted to Play tends to date this release somewhat, but it also provides a document of the hardcore scene in its purely independent phase, long before the major-label punk rock feeding frenzy of the early to mid-\'90s. For the trivia file, this release also marks the origin of the continuing SNFU tradition of seven-word album titles. And No One Else Wanted to Play is classic early-\'80s hardcore at its best and brightest. The ever-present wit of Mr. Chi Pig combined with the frenzied but skillful guitar attack of brothers Brent and Marc Belke creates a unique style that many hardcore bands continue to draw from but never quite duplicate. A must for devoted fans of the genre and a worthy introduction to early-\'80s hardcore for the uninitiated. ~ Paul Henderson, All Music Guide', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61MDjGTZ%2B7L._SY300_.jpg', 8.99, true),

They reunite for their first unaccompanied duo album,Face to Face.

Where Corea is likely to go for the exclamatory chord, Ozone is more likely to go for the quick, smooth arpeggio. Ozone and Burton both love to run through chord changes in brisk, yet seemingly relaxed phrases which manage to touch on most of the possible notes in any harmony. These seamless, graceful lines are often extended at great length and then traded off to the comping partner. They tackle two Thelonious Monk tunes, three Ozone originals, South American numbers by Antonio Carlos Jobim and Astor Piazzolla, standards by Rodgers & Hart and Benny Goodman, and Steve Swallow\'s &quot;Eiderdown.&quot; One might wish for some dirty low notes or harsh chords to offset all this dizzying lyricism, but there\'s no denying the duo\'s superb command of jazz romanticism.--Geoffrey Himes', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SRC03TF3L._SX300_.jpg', 11.43, true),

But Itoh is more than a big fish in a small pond; she has shown herself to be utterly at ease with the medium of Western popular song. For this concert appearance, recorded in 1994 at the Japan Society in New York, she is joined by a band of crack session musicians, led by drummer Steve Gadd and featuring saxophonist Ronnie Cuber, guitarist John Tropea, percussionist Ralph MacDonald, bass player Will Lee, and keyboardist Soichi Noriki. In the hands of players of this caliber, Itoh\'s repertoire (ranging from pop/jazz standards like "All of Me" and "Old Devil Moon" to more contemporary fare like John Lennon\'s "Love" and Billy Joel\'s "New York State of Mind," along with tunes by Antonio Carlos Jobim and even a vocal adaptation of Rodrigo\'s "Concerto de Aranjuez") is never less than impeccably played, beautifully arranged, and an ideal showcase for the singer.While occasional mispronunciations ("am" comes out more like "ahm") reveal that English isn\'t Itoh\'s first language, she has a genuine feel for this music; and if she isn\'t strictly a jazz singer, she can definitely swing. Perhaps most important, Itoh is a mature artist who knows how to use her instrument. She can sing with considerable power, even revealing the occasional soulful, gutsy growl. But unlike the Celine Dion school of so-called divas, who wrench the melismatic excess out of every note, Itoh doesn\'t overdo it.

Its first video recording--visually lavish and generally well-sung--includes all the ballet music, which is often reduced or omitted, and (for reasons that are not entirely clear--maybe a preference for 19th-century costumes) updates the action from the 13th century to the Napoleonic era.

The hushed intimacy of Young\'s playing and  singing, sans backup, in such a setting can be unforgettable, and this  widescreen presentation captures that delicate beauty.While the play list has its share of familiar gems, the emphasis is on a group  of thematically and musically related songs Young had been arranging just  prior to the CSNY reunion. Among them are gentle,  double-edged reflections on childhood ("Daddy Went Walkin\'"), elemental odes  to mature love ("Silver & Gold"), and richly imagistic allusions to loss  and rediscovered innocence.  These and a number of other new titles are largely of a piece, 30&nbsp;years  later, withAfter the Gold Rushand its blend of melancholy  stateliness, crosscurrents of pure emotion, and touches of the mystical. The  difference is in the experience of time:After the Gold Rushconfirms  the shifting, glorious colors of a sensitive young man\'s constant immediacy,  while the new material onSilver & Goldblurs all boundaries between  past and present.Young doesn\'t fail to stoke our affection with his absent-minded  strolls and sloppy prepping of his instruments, but his  emotional concentration on standards such as "City of Brotherly  Love," "Harvest Moon," and "Long May You Run" (played on pipe organ and  sounding like the church hymn it was meant to be) is something to  behold.--Tom Keogh', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51em86r74ML._SY300_.jpg', 35.0, true),

Everything works together, although on paper the combination may look risky: a cast of Russian men and English women; staging that combines the elegant realism of 18th-century costumes with a surreal set design; realistic props (a staircase, a bridge railing, gambling tables) enclosed in stark white walls covered with abstract black squiggles. In some scenes, it looks like there is furniture clinging to the ceiling, and one scene is lit garishly but appropriately in shades of red.The air of macabre madness reaches its peak in the climactic scene where the old Countess (Felicity Palmer) is literally scared to death by the young, tragic hero Herman (Yuri Marusin). Both perform with spectacular impact, and the effect is reinforced even by the chair--shaped like a human skeleton--in which she is seated. Marusin and Palmer stand out dramatically in performances calculated for theatrical impact rather than pretty sound. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent, and video director Victir Maniura deserves special mention for some outstanding camera work.

Luckily for music fans, he decided that this music was his calling and chose to press on. By 1971, his Clinch Mountain Boys were again one of the finest ensembles in bluegrass. These 20 songs come from Stanley\'s renaissance 1971-1973 period (with one stray tune from 1976), one of his most productive post-Carter eras, and showcases the classic Stanley sound--raw and plaintive--across the classic Stanley repertoire: old-time folk songs mixed with staples from theCarter Family,Mainer\'s Mountaineers, and, of course, the Stanley Brothers. Veteran fiddler Curly Ray Cline and lead singer Roy Lee Centers offer sterling support for Stanley\'s wailing vocals and versatile banjo, which covers a variety of styles from clawhammer to three-finger.

The prospect of a cutting-edge concert DVD from  a \'70s rocker who\'s mostly been MIA during the intervening decades might seem  baffling to all but his staunchest fans. But Peter Frampton\'s particular 15  minutes of fame were rooted in his sturdy prowess as a live player, and that  crowd-pleasing instinct kicks into gear quickly onLive in Detroit.  The  expatriate British guitarist, singer, and songwriter cheerfully admits that this  well-shot, crisply recorded concert from Pine Knob amphitheater is banking on  the lack of any video companion to his epochal live double album,Frampton Comes Alive, which  broke sales records following its 1976 release. Accordingly,Detroitserves up a set list featuring the earlier set\'s high points and preserving the  front man\'s affable, enthusiastic rapport.Those virtues won\'t entirely neutralize the initial shock of seeing the former  rock heartthrob as he crowds 50. The shoulder-length locks that made him a  poster boy (and supplied a then-chic androgyny) are gone, his hair now close- cropped and white, and he wears small wire-rim glasses that reinforce a  comparatively clerical look, even in dark jeans and T-shirt.  But when Frampton  and his current quartet launch into old arena workhorses like "Baby (Something\'s  Happening)," or signature hits like "Show Me the Way" and "Baby I Love Your  Way," he shows his singing and lead guitar playing are both unchanged.In short, meat-and-potatoes musicianship, an eager-to-please affection for his  audience, and that archetypal song book of \'70s radio favorites all play to  Frampton\'s strengths and to his audience\'s expectations, right up to those  talkbox effects that sounded anachronistic until Cher dusted them off for her  Europop-inflected comeback.

Still fun, still  refreshing with its post-punk vitality and Bowie-esque sound, "Cut a Long Story  Short" cheerfully closes out this 1990 Birmingham, England, concert before a  massive crowd. Not that the preceding 17 or so songs on this performance  document are anything less than spirited. But in Spandau Ballet tradition, they  are monuments to the kind of musical proficiency and gloss originally washed  away by the recording industry\'s sea change, almost a lifetime ago, to a rock-friendly medium. Without a lick of irony, the band\'s determination to be your  father\'s preferred pop wins one over through sheer earnestness. While there  isn\'t a heck of a lot of variation in the sound and arrangements of these songs,  that\'s no reason not to admire Hadley\'s ripened vocals, stronger and more  expressive than ever. Gary Kemp, so menacing as a character actor in films, is  Hadley\'s delightful stage partner, anchoring the band while dancing in and out  of the shared spotlight. (By contrast, handsome brother Martin Kemp barely makes  it into the camera frame for a full 90 minutes. For shame, Mr. Director.) From  the hit catalogue, "Gold," "Chant No. 1," and "Only When You Leave" are  reminders of just how good drummer John Keeble and the versatile Steve Norman  (saxophone, percussion, etc.) can be. "Communication" is glazed gospel touched  by glee, and "Lifeline" demonstrates how you don\'t have to be in Oasis to flaunt  a Beatles influence.--Tom Keogh', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516W40D6JBL._SY300_.jpg', 10.88, true),

The program takes a look at the choir in formal performance and rehearsal, and also provides some special yuletide scenes of the boys preparing for holiday festivities -- bringing in a tree, putting up decorations, eating treats, and enjoying other Christmas customs. Founded in 1498, the Vienna Boys\' Choir has sung in cathedrals, royal courts, and private concerts for half a millenium. Many renowned musicians, such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Antonio Salieri, Christoph Willibald Gluck, and Anton Bruckner have worked with the choir. Franz Schubert and Franz Joseph Haydn were choir members in their early years. In 1918, after the breakdown of the Hapsburg empire, the Austrian government took over the court opera, but not the boys\' choir. Due to the dedication of private supporters, the Boys Choir has continued through the years.

Not one of Hendrix\'s stellar performances, and frayed a bit by the late hour and equipment problems, the concert nevertheless finds the legendary guitarist in a gracious mood, asking the crowd to be patient with his tuning and even allow him to start one song over after a bumpy start. Backed by Mitch Mitchell on drums and Buddy Cox on bass, Hendrix\'s playing on "Voodoo Chile" and "Machine Gun" has power but lacks snap, yet most of his mid-song solos prove bold and lyrical. Everything pulls together, however, for a hypnotic rendering of "Red House," which instantly sets down a snaking groove and gives Hendrix room for some jittery phrases.

What makesThe Christmas Angelespecially entertaining is the combination of graceful skating by such well-known talents as Dorothy Hamill and Elvis Stojko and theemotive music of Mannheim Steamroller.  The story tells of an evil gargoyle named Gargon (Stojko) who steals the Christmas angel (Tonia Kwiatkowski) from atop a snowy village\'s Christmas tree, thereby preventing the arrival of Christmas. A young mother (Hamill), along with a host of toys-come-to-life, follows Gargon into the dark otherworld in an attempt to rescue the stolen angel.  In the end, the angel is freed along with a host of lost souls and Christmas is saved.

This is particularly true of the music of Trinidad and Tobago, identified in the American popular mind with the synthetic Calypso-meets-disco sound of soca. While soca is a more complex and worthy genre than some opine, it\'s associated less with Calypso\'s social protest and hilariously witty innuendo than with less-graceful expressions like popular soca artist Arrow\'s sexual request in "Winey Winey" to "winey winey \'pon your pum-pum." This fascinating CD puts the gleam on the fine old wood of the earliest Calypso songs, featuring wonderfully baroque orchestrations from the finest T&T; Calypso orchestras from 1914 to the \'50s, with elegant keyboard passages, swooning strings, snaking horns, exotic male choruses with African overtones, and the sublime vocals of seminal Calypsonians such as Lionel Belasco, Roaring Lion, Babb and Williams, Houdini, Lord Executor, and Lord Invader.

Perhaps he feels he no longer has to prove himself in his adopted homeland, for the Cuban expatriate plays with a subtlety and tenderness unheard in his previous two U.S. outings. Sandoval and Legrand play a wonderfully restrained, unaccompanied trumpet/piano duet on Gillespie\'s &quot;Con Alma.&quot; Sandoval shows his fiery side when he plays his own &quot;Blue 93&quot; with a Latin-jazz septet.

The packaging tells us the Doors swept through London,   Stockholm, Frankfurt, and Amsterdam during a 1968 tour documented here, but   there\'s no way to appreciate that save for a random clip or two of Jim Morrison  milling about outside concert venues, talking with fans. Otherwise, we see the  same sort of obfuscating on-stage close-ups of Morrison you can see in any  footage of a Doors gig, stumbling around, crooning, and reciting poetry to  minimalist accompaniment by Ray Manzarek on keyboards, John Densmore on drums,  and Robby Krieger on guitar. Unless one can see, in the mind\'s eye, what the  band is up to from the point of view of a kid in the 30th row, there\'s no way to  really get the hypnotic, Dionysian effect for which the Doors were justifiably  famous. Thus, for anyone who can imagine such a thing, or take it on faith,  there\'s good reason to enjoy performances of "Spanish Caravan," "Five to One,"  and two versions of "Light My Fire."

The video is no substitute for a course in geology, but the various skits and presentations do make principles of geology that a student has already learned easier to remember. The review takes the basic format of covering basic topics such as geologic time and minerals, and moves forward into fairly detailed discussions of geologic principles. Flashy graphics illustrate basic principles, and mnemonic devices abound. Perhaps remembering a routine centered on the concept that the Paleozoic era is the "Partying Era" sounds inane, but the silly sentence one uses for the drill will help a student remember the various eras that made up the Paleozoic.

The musicians, however, represented the soul of the Kansas City influx. The first 10 tracks--five tunes with one alternate each--come from September 1938 and feature a group drawn from theCount BasieOrchestra\'s ranks. It\'s the great Basie rhythm section of bassist Walter Page, drummer Jo Jones, and rhythm guitarist Freddie Green (who also sings on "Them There Eyes"), with a frontline of Lester Young, trumpeterBuck Clayton, and Eddie Durham, who\'s heard far more prominently on electric guitar than trombone. A master of half-valve smears, Clayton sounds superb, whether elegantly muted or expressively open, but it\'s Young who will rivet a listener\'s attention, both on tenor sax or playing clarinet with a strikingly original sound and conception.Young\'s clarinet virtually defines the sonority of later "cool" alto saxophonists likeLee KonitzandPaul Desmond, and the blend with the transparent textures of the two guitars is particularly advanced. The second session is by a very different Kansas City Six from 1944, with Young and Jones the only returning members. It\'s a far more conventional setting, with trumpeter Bill Coleman and trombonist Dicky Wells competing in brashness and pianist Joe Bushkin in place of the guitars. The sometimes aggressive cast to the band only highlights Young\'s superbly relaxed phrasing. His opening solos on the three takes of "I Got Rhythm" are textbook example of relaxed swing, and their inspiration to Wells is apparent in his solos that follow. The CD concludes with four tracks by the Kansas City Five from March 1938, the earliest session here. It\'s the first Kansas City Six without Young present, still well worth hearing for the superb play of Clayton, Durham, and the rhythm section.--Stuart Broomer', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41KJS87V74L._SX300_.jpg', 11.49, true),

There are several basic parallels, especially in this orchestra-enhanced concert reworking of his more propulsive, anthemic compositions. Yanni, who in concert sometimes strikes the rapturous two-keyboard "iron-cross" pose that served as one of Keith Emerson\'s trademarks, uses, as ELP did, classical and world-music influences to elevate pop-inclined compositions to more sophisticated levels. He then turbocharges the whole concoction with bold strokes of prog-rock bravura to give his finest pieces a dramatic, chest-swelling, larger-than-life impact. A key difference between the two acts, of course, is Yanni possesses a much stronger romantic streak, plus he refrains from attacking his keyboards with sharp objects. At his best, Yanni strikes incendiary sparks with the driving, celebratory quality of his music, and this production, culling some of the best audio moments from his much-televised 1993 concert performance in Athens, is a most appealing showcase. Yanni can sometimes strike the sonic hammer as forcefully as a Greek god ("Santorini," "Keys to Imagination") and, on this album at least, gives even overtly romantic pieces ("One Man\'s Dream," "Swept Away") a warmly masculine flair.

In his view, we should accept that we all have imperfections, not to mention imperfect relationships, and we should avoid indulging in unhealthy self-abasement triggered by our perceived lack of perfection. It\'s fine, says Moore, to embrace our occasional mistakes, proclaiming "let the fool in." Citing examples from sources ranging from Renaissance philosophers to his father, who works as a plumber, Moore meanders along, mentioning how we should seek depth in everyday living. His soft-spoken teachings are often entertaining, though the presentation isn\'t particularly focused, and some may find Moore\'s insights to be little more than a maddening melange of New Age ideas.

Not an easy concept for the competitive, goal-oriented Western mind, which is precisely one of the things that makes Alan Watts\'s guide to meditation a fascinating piece of work. Watts, an Englishman who died in 1973 (this piece was shot by filmmaker Elda Hartley in 1971), was an authority on Eastern thought and spiritual practice. Here he guides the viewer through a 25-minute program that\'s part documentary, part useful guide to meditation. While Watts explains such practical techniques as breathing, posture, and the chanted "aum" mantra, one can just as easily find oneself lost in the kaleidoscope of extraordinarily beautiful, natural images that accompany his words. All in all, those seeking "the naked experience of reality itself" and a connection to "the still, small voice within" will be enchanted byThe Art of Meditation.

He begins with the fundamentals of the "Cuban motion," as he calls it, which is "all in the hip." Mastering the merengue requires more than just memorizing the steps. The dance springs from this essential hip movement, and if you don\'t get a feel for it, you won\'t get a feel for the dance. Therefore, Pozo spends a good part of the tape slowly and clearly explaining posture and weight emphasis on the foot, to ensure that you\'ll be able dance the merengue without looking like a robot.

Looking at the chair more closely, however, reveals multiple perspectives. Vanishing point is demonstrated by a graphic artist using a computer and clip-art animals. Whimsical cartoons show how art can "come alive" through the simple use of basic principles.

The group\'s chunky,  muscular riffing through the 1970s and \'80s made it a rock powerhouse in a way  that its earlier incarnation, the Jefferson Airplane, was never meant to be. But  in the few years that Marty Balin joined two of his mates from the Airplane,  Paul Kantner and Grace Slick, for its retooled edition, bombast was mitigated by  a ripened sensuality and other pleasures. Between Balin\'s splendid love songs,  Slick\'s sass, Kantner\'s lyrical castles in the sky, and guitarist Craig  Chaquico\'s prankish versatility, the Starship was a fun, sexy, uplifting outfit.  By 1983, however, with Balin long gone, Kantner on the way out, and shrill  vocalist Mickey Thomas in the mix, the Starship looked and sounded like an  anachronism. Sadly, that\'s what we have here onThe Definitive Concert.  Thomas seems to be screeching at a single frequency on "Winds of Change" and  "Out of Control," while Slick spends much of the time delivering a wide-eyed  stare into the camera that seemed trippy enough in 1967, but here looks  insistent and vain.

Though Geils was a fine blues rock guitarist, it was Peter Wolf\'s vocals and Magic Dick\'s harmonica solos that made the J. Geils Band a legendary live act in the \'70s, and it was the songs written by Wolf and keyboardist Seth Justman that gave the band its pop breakthrough in the early \'80s. Geils\'s grasp of the rhythmic requirements of the Chicago blues provided the foundation for everything the band did, however, and it provides the solid basis for this likable album with Magic Dick.The J. Geils Band began in 1966 as a trio (Geils, Dick, and bassist Danny Klein) exploring the music of the Chicago blues giants. Now Geils and Dick are doing it again--nine of the 13 tracks on the new album are credited to Muddy Waters, Little Walter or Sonny Boy Williamson--only this time they have the maturity to let the material breathe. Instead of cramming every possible note into each song, these older, wiser musicians have pared down their arrangements to the essential notes. This allows Geils\'s swinging, jazz-inflected guitar solos to unfurl with natural ease and for Dick to more fully harmonize his solos.Dick proves a competent lead singer, but he lacks the special edge of a Wolf, much less a Waters. As a result, the instrumental performances are the best part ofBluestime.--Geoffrey Himes', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41PTK9NJ8PL._SX300_.jpg', 11.88, true),

It was with this group that the 20-year-old Tyner made his recording debut. But after 6 months, Tyner heard of Coltrane forming his group and went to join. He went on to record some 20 albums with the Coltrane group. Also during this time, he recorded a number of albums for the Impulse label under his own name. He also created several memorable albums with the musicians like Ron Carter, Lee Morgan, and Joe Henderson.In 1972 he was nominated for 2 Grammies and named Album of the Year by the Down Beat Critics Poll. In the all 1978, Tyner spent time working with another band, the Milestone Jazzstars, with Ron Carter, Sonny Rollins, and Al Foster.Tyner possesses one of t most galvanizing and instantly identifiable techniques in jazz piano; percussive, powerful and yet very sensitive.

Veteran producer  Bruce Fairbairn specifically urged the band to return to the sound that made it  famous--poetic lyrics, thickly layered fusion of guitar, bass, keyboards, and  sophisticated melodic structures. Whether Yes achieved its goal is subject to  debate, but die-hard Yes-philes will surely agree this is the finest video  presentation of this enduring band and its music. The Dolby Digital 5.1-channel  audio is exquisitely distinct, showcasing the seasoned musicianship of guitarist  Steve Howe, bassist Chris Squire, drummer Alan White, and next generation Yes  members Igor Khoroshev (replacing Rick Wakeman on keyboards) and Billy Sherwood  (who later left the band) on guitar.After 30 years as Yes frontman and vocalist, Jon Anderson leads in fine form.  His mellow enthusiasm is genuine, and this 15-song set (recorded at the Las  Vegas House of Blues club) catches the band on a very good night. Squire is a  playful match to Howe\'s reliable precision, and the best of the new songs  (particularly "Homeworld" [The Ladder]) are almost as good as the  classics. And while the Bob Marley tribute song "The Messenger" is best  forgotten, few could deny that Yes has indeed retained its vitality after all  these years. In addition to interviews with all the band members (except White),  impressive extra features on the DVD include a Dolby 5.1 version of the  "Homeworld" album track, accompanied by computer-animated excerpts from the  "Homeworld" CD-ROM game, and an HTML version of the Yesworld Web site. A  conspicuous effort to attract a new generation of cyber-savvy fans?

After 20 years with the Lilly Brothers, Stover recorded this 1972 album, his first as a solo artist, with a young David Grisman on mandolin.Things in Lifeoffers classic Stover originals, such as the poignant title track and the instrumental "Rockwood Deer Chase," along with fiddle tunes reworked for banjo and a series of charming old-time numbers Stover learned from his parents. Charlie Monroe\'s "Valley of Peace" features strong vocal harmonies from Stover and Dave Dillon, although Stover\'s versatile and innovative banjo techniques always get top billing.--Marc Greilsamer', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-OSqf-DZL._SY300_.jpg', 17.01, true),

Shorn of explicit scholarship or careful allusions to regional parent styles, this is proudly blue-collar blues rock designed purely for partying.  With his short, slicked-back hair and a buffed-up physique clad in black slacks and polo shirt, Castro doesn\'t resemble anybody you\'d expect to find in the smoky juke joints or shotgun shacks of blues lore; his athletic performing style and grinning ebullience likewise seem incongruous if considered in the context of traditional blues\' more harrowing, confessional standards. There isn\'t a hellhound in sight, but then Castro\'s enthusiastic Fillmore audience clearly couldn\'t care less.In fact, Castro and his quartet (covering bass, drums, and tenor sax) flex a sturdy, if generic, blues style that reaches for the same \'60s soul economy audible in the early sound of Robert Cray, whose own career began with the sort of pumped-up bar band aesthetic that Castro plies here.  Like Cray, Castro\'s songbook is largely preoccupied with sex and heartbreak, albeit without the lyric invention that Cray and original collaborator Dennis Walker achieved.  From a technical standpoint, the show is well shot and cleanly recorded, its surround mix simply adding ambience to the traditional stage mix presented by front and center channels.  Those familiar with Castro and the CD version of the same show will note that Blind Pig uses a slightly different song list here; it\'s worth pondering whether the DVD, which clocks in at just 60&nbsp;minutes, would have been improved by including the other songs available on CD but not here.--Sam Sutherland', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51mfR5v3gBL._SY300_.jpg', 13.96, true),

Less structured and formal than her previous film, the cult classicWithout You I\'m Nothing,I\'m Still Here... Damn It!catches La Diva Sandra in San Francisco, some six months pregnant and laying waste to the cultural detritus of the \'90s. Nothing and no one emerges unscathed from Bernhard\'s lacerating wit as she paints a vast, swirling portrait of today\'s media-saturated landscape. This breathtaking ride showcases Bernhard in top form as she offers commentary on everyone from Mariah Carey to Courtney Love, as well as the waifish girl singers of Lilith Fair, to whom she offers the advice, "Just get out of that dirty bathtub for starters!" Bernhard is not afraid to call a spade a spade--and make that spade live to regret the error of its ways--butI\'m Still Here... Damn It!is also about the efforts to keep your soul pure under increasingly superficial circumstances. Bernhard touches on issues of religion, self-fulfillment, bravery, and motherhood, and utilizes her stunning voice as well as her scathing wit. A tribute to Christine McVie, "Nightingale," is both a send-up and homage to the Fleetwood Mac pianist, and Bernhard ends her show with an intoxicating Moroccan prayer and a stunning cover of "Midnight Train to Georgia." And as photographed by legendary cinematographer Haskell Wexler (Medium Cool,Matewan), Bernhard is an electrical presence, beautiful and shocking at the same time. At only an hour, it\'s a condensed version of her show (for the full-on effect, buy thesoundtrack), but amazing nonetheless. The DVD features about 30 minutes of bonus footage, including ribald observations of Rosie O\'Donnell, Melanie Griffith, and Liza Minnelli, among others.--Mark Englehart', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BARKZGV5L._SY300_.jpg', 13.47, true),

However, fans of this brand of showbiz razzmatazz will be satisfied with the duets between the women (especially trading verses on a medley of "Happy Days Are Here Again" and "Get Happy"). Judy opens the show with the reliable chest sweller "Once in a Lifetime" (no relation to the Talking Heads tune) and delivers a tutorial in song dynamics with "The Man That Got Away." She appears rather shrunken and tired but still comes on  like a trouper, fending off the audience\'s constant heckling for "Over the Rainbow" (as though she might forget it?) before finally handing the song back to them as a touching sing-along.

When, after a 14-year layoff, he returned to live music with the Sun Rhythm Section in 1986, his raspy baritone growl and stinging lead guitar were miraculously intact. All he needed to make some more great rockabilly records were the right songs. He got those on the 1992 Hightone album,Tennessee Border, and he gets some more on this self-titled album. These two titles rank with Jerry Lee Lewis\'sYoung Bloodas the best 1990s albums by the first generation of rockabilly heroes.--Geoffrey Himes', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41nMhu1r-KL._SY300_.jpg', 15.99, true),

This collection of songs is a truly wonderful experience -- just the right mix of classics and new pieces -- performed by two of the most talented artists around. When you listen to these artists perform, you\'ll hear a long tradition of country music harmony -- echoes of the Blue Sky Boys, the Delmore Brothers, and, of course, the Louvin Brothers -- presented lovingly and with all the care and respect it deserves. I know you\'ll have the same, deep feelings about this wonderful, real music that thousands of people feel every time Robert and Charles step up to a microphone.

The slow blues "Dirty Work at the Crossroads" addedJimmy McCracklin\'s rolling piano to Brown\'s bold and brash guitar work, but it was the 1954 instrumental "Okie Dokie Stomp" that put Brown on the map.

The band was a sensible compromise--a platform that provided Stills with a versatile ensemble of instrumental peers posing far less threat to their leader\'s ego. He had wisely chosen one of California rock\'s most dependably tasteful musicians, former Byrd and Flying Burrito Brothers cofounder Chris Hillman, as his de facto lieutenant, providing a solid vocal foil and a capable songwriter.  Stills designed a lineup that could move convincingly from country-rock to swaying, percussive grooves with a Latin thrust.This 40-minute live studio performance, taped without an audience for a German broadcast, captures the essence of Manassas\'s debut albumDown the Road, confirming the strength of Stills\'s choices as well as the ultimately slight value of the songs written for and with that band. At its best, Manassas sketches a warm Stills-Hillman vocal stamp that\'s pleasing if still generic, and the instrumental interplay is likewise confident if only fleetingly inspired.  The production injects some now dated, even corny visuals, including solarized psychedelic shots used as backdrops. But the original mono sound quality is detailed and well-mixed, confirming the superior equipment and more sympathetic ears of the German crew.

Fitzgerald was a teenager when she began recording with Webb; the complete singer of ballads, show tunes, and scat improvisation existed only in the future. What Fitzgerald possessed was a great voice in embryo, and these CDs give listeners a chance to hear her growing in skill and confidence with each successive session. Her pitch and diction were already good, and she clearly had a unique talent for rhythmic phrasing. In fact, the novelty and rhythm songs she was usually called on to perform drew only on that aspect of her talent, songs of the first rank--then jealously guarded by music publishers and record companies--being unavailable to her. When she gets the opportunity with better material--as on "I Want to Be Happy"--she acquits herself admirably. Her hit of "A-Tisket, A-Tasket," brilliantly propelled by Webb\'s drumming, still sounds inspired. There were some bands of the period that were more artful, but few as singularly devoted to the principle of swing and none with a drummer more dynamic or creative than Webb.

DVD  companies ought to take note of its laziness and avoid all mistakes in future concert film releases. For starters, don\'t release a rock show with muddled sound that continually drops in and out, faded and grainy visual quality, and absolutely zero production value. To be fair, Blue Oyster Cult\'s dreadful performance doesn\'t help any. Though the packaging states that this is "vintage" BLC at their "peak," most fans know that by 1976, the progressive heavy-metal band was already five years past its prime. The  11&nbsp;featured tunes show the band moving away from their raw, heavy origins and becoming a rock clich&eacute;. Bombastic jams such as "Buck\'s Boogie" and "Dominance and  Submission" indulgently wander forever; lead vocalist Eric Bloom strikes macho poses and preaches about the legalization of drugs. The topper comes when a dopey laser show follows both drum and guitar solos--and the audience cheers louder for the lights. Even BOC\'s guitarist--and leader--Donald (Buck Dharma) Roeser appears bored, and he\'s the one responsible for this stuff. He can\'t even muster the energy to pull off a memorable encore of BOC\'s only hit, "Don\'t Fear the Reaper," instead singing the lyrics like someone\'s got a gun to his head. If the disc is worth anything at all, it\'s as a definition of impotent, bloated \'70s arena rock, and a clear demonstration of why punk needed to happen and what it fought against.

Both musically and visually, the set\'s eight tracks shift quickly from the mannered country settings and modest production values of the opening "Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?" to the big-budget scale and soft-focus pop romanticism of the title song: from her earliest videos\' down-home settings in funky coffee shops and sun-dappled meadows (where we see the heroine riding her horse, naturally), the viewer is transported to the Sahara and gliding shots of Twain, bedecked in a gauzy gown, strolling past pyramids and temple ruins as if enacting some regal reincarnation.From that point forward, the visual artifacts of conventional country videos retreat, even as Twain\'s flirty, feisty persona dials down its country accents to embrace a more mainstream synthesis of pop and rock.  Twain\'s brand of charisma is often very broad indeed, punctuated with winks and hearty wiggles, and her "controversial" sexuality (as measured by Nashville\'s demure standards) translates to occasional deployment of her buffed midriff and d&eacute;colletage. Fans will revel in her hale, camera-savvy image and hooky but utterly conventional songs, even if more neutral observers may detect a certain generic safety in Twain\'s repurposed array of romantic sentiments laced with flashes of self-reliance.--Sam Sutherland', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZDF2D2DWL._SY300_.jpg', 17.28, true),

The dimensions may have been scaled down for this DVD release, but the show is still huge in energy and talent. Filmed during a European leg of  the Rolling Stones\'Steel Wheelstour, this production boasts 15 songs  and an extraordinary stage set with inflatable floozies (for "Honky Tonk  Woman") and wild dogs (rather cleverly for "Street Fighting Man"). The  Stones\' set emphasizes material from the late 1960s and early \'70s ("Tumbling  Dice," "Happy," "You Can\'t Always Get What You Want"), but the band\'s  performance is so furious that the show is far from a pandering oldies act. Highlights include "Paint It Black," at once brutal and delicate, as well as  a muscular "Rock and a Hard Place," a psychedelicized "2,000 Light Years from  Home," and a cheeky "It\'s Only Rock \'n\' Roll." Once kings of a gloriously  sloppy sound, the Stones prove to be as effective in their artistic maturity  with small, breathtaking touches as they are with chunky orchestration.   Guitarists Keith Richards and Ron Wood play as if they are of one mind,  Richards providing powerful leads while his partner captures some of the  texture of the group\'s original recordings. Bassist Bill Wyman, still in the  band at this phase, offers wit and an encyclopedic grasp of rhythm & blues  history, while drummer Charlie Watts adds control and swing.  Mick Jagger  prowls, climbs around the set, and delivers all the charismatic goods for  adoring audiences, even touching the forbidden fruit again in a feverish  peformance of "Sympathy for the Devil."

Choosing between them is not easy. Musically, both are  excellent. Domingo has more name recognition than Luis Lima, and Rosi\'s film  catches him in top form. But Lima is vocally and visually a precise embodiment  of Don Jos&eacute;, the soldier seduced and betrayed by Carmen and finally  driven to murder her. Migenes (in Rosi\'s film) gives a superb portrayal of the  capricious Gypsy woman, but for my taste Maria Ewing\'s Carmen is even more  vivid, natural, and subtly nuanced. Leontina Vaduva is exactly right as the  innocent country girl Micaela, and Gino Quilico swaggers convincingly through  the role of the bullfighter Escamillo.The advantage of the film is presence and realism, particularly outdoor  landscapes with plenty of space for the soldiers and smugglers to move around.  Escamillo faces a real bull in a three-dimensional Plaza de Toros, something  necessarily kept offstage in the Covent Garden production. A danger not always  avoided in the film production is overstatement. There is more subtlety in  Covent Garden\'s staging--there has to be--as well as a higher overall level of  musicianship.

Here, the ever-proud proprietor of Toad Hall hangs up his former preoccupation with motorcars in favor of a far hipper mode of transport--airplanes. Though he fancies himself an avid aviator, Toady\'s nothing but trouble when he takes to the skies. Enlisted to survey the wild woods from up high for Moley, who never made it to Rat\'s house amid a river-swelling winter storm, he loops-the-loop one time too many, sending Ratty tumbling in thin air. Then there\'s the small matter that he swiped the plane he\'s piloting, an offense punishable by a lengthy prison sentence. And he\'s already a wanted toad for escaping on stolen-motorcar charges. While Toady\'s tricking an innocent chimneysweep into changing identities with him, Rat\'s semi-spiritual river wisdom tells him Mole\'s still alive, and, indeed, the weary traveler straggles up just in time for his own memorial service, requesting cheese on toast and a glass of hot toddy. All\'s well again along the river, but Toady\'s captured, and his complicated web of criminal deception lands him in court on murder charges. Well-connected, formidable Badger bails him out, but a lesson in humility awaits the wily bugger back at Toad Hall.

The fractious  intra-band relationships that have characterized Black Sabbath\'s long career  were a major inspiration for the writers ofThis Is Spinal Tap, and so  the Sabs\' reunion created something pleasingly symmetrical and evocative of the  closing scenes of that fine film.The concert footage was taken from six of the concerts on that tour. It is  conclusive proof that the original quartet of Osbourne, Iommi, Butler, and       Ward (or, in Osbourne\'s words, "four dickheads from Aston, near Birmingham")  were every bit as exuberantly juvenile a rock & roll band in their early 50s as  their late teens. Also included is a sketchy biography and interviews with the  band by Henry Rollins, one of the countless contemporary musicians influenced by  Sabbath.

Twain\'s mid-\'90s breakthrough, fueled by formidable production polish and carefully groomed videos, conspicuously delayed live shows until long after the expatriate Canadian\'s success crossed into platinum territory--an omission that prompted some skeptics to theorize that the would-be megastar\'s talent was accomplished through studio legerdemain.Shania Twain Livemay benefit from plenty of polish and more than a little calculation in its staging, but the singer-songwriter\'s long apprenticeship in lounge bands and resort revues north of the border is apparent.  Whether one loves or loathes her songs, Twain herself comes across as a seasoned performer who knows how to work the audience.Equally apparent, and equally unlikely to resolve the division between fans and foes, is Twain\'s crossover agenda. Scaled for the arenas that Twain and her handlers targeted early on, the concert is closer in pace and power-chords to a mainstream rock show than most country acts, an orientation that aligns the star with Garth Brooks\'s swaggering attack rather than most country songstresses. Her band may boast three fiddlers, but their slashing attack emulates the kilowatt buzz of the rock guitarists that share the scrim, who pull off familiar string-bending flourishes. As for the front woman, in her electric-green leopard-print top, hip-hugging pants, and meticulously permed, waist-length hair, she resembles some improbably aerobicized white Rastafarian.The set list is a generous one, reproducing most of Twain\'s back-to-back platinum albums, and illustrates her skill at mixing melting ballads, flirtatious rockers that enable her to strut her physical beauty, and songs testifying to her self-reliance.  Still, for all Twain\'s assertions that she won\'t suffer fools gladly, the songs ultimately reveal a traditional romanticism with a moderate, post-feminist spark. One need only check out the power equation behind such songs as "Honey, I\'m Home" and "Any Man of Mine" to recognize Twain\'s themes are ultimately much older than their crossover wrappers.--Sam Sutherland', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516W3ZC5G0L._SY300_.jpg', 1.95, true),

Buffett himself introduces each clip, providing personal and career anecdotes as he unspools the videos in chronological order. In the process, we watch his maturation from freewheeling Florida hippie to laid-back Everyman. As presented here, you can hear how Buffett nudged his music from an identifiable branch of \'70s singer-songwriter chic toward his singular amalgam of pop, country, and rock, with liberal garnishes of calypso and reggae.For a self-professed reluctant video subject, Buffett has managed to capture a substantial cross-section of his music visually, starting with early songs like "Pencil Thin Moustache" and "Come Monday." The early clips afford glimpses of his Key West stomping grounds before that sun-baked Bohemia was transformed into a tourist trap decorated with Hemingway, tropical drinks, and, of course, Buffett himself.Videophiles may smile at some of the clunky production values or dated period details, but Buffett\'s sybaritic faithful will flock to this virtual road map of their idol\'s particular theme park for boomer fantasies of escape.

Cheap Trick used smart hooks, trashy lyrics, and a  passionate yet fun approach that made other late \'70s dinosaurs seem even  sillier. But after their breakout record,Live at Budokan, it seems the  boys began believing in the stuff they were singing and playing a little too  much. The band\'s still around, and their live act can still make for an  entertaining evening, but you got to take a lot of the bad with a bit of the  good. Same applies to this DVD, in which the band was filmed in Australia during  their comeback in 1988. The awful power ballad "The Flame" had restored interest  in the band, and energy-wise at least, Cheap Trick seems psyched to be center  stage again. Guitarist Rick Nielsen is all over the place (both physically and  in terms of his playing), while Robin Zander\'s (is there a better name for a  lead vocalist?) hair... Well, you\'ve just got to see it.

Better yet, the documentary\'s producers elicit atypically straightforward, revealing interviews from the group\'s stealthy principals, songwriters Walter Becker and Donald Fagen, who jettison enough of their signature sarcasm to touch on the autobiographical threads, cultural anomie, and serious musical ambition audible in their work. In that respect, the production rivals any extant interviews with this proudly cerebral, occasionally evasive musical team.The duo, along with producer Gary Katz, engineer Roger Nichols, and a generous cross-section of the crack New York and Los Angeles musicians featured on the sessions, dissect the sleek layers of the songs both musically and lyrically, both in modern performances featuring the original players and in control-room playbacks of the original multitrack master tapes.

Not only did the younger Stanley choose to carry on (at the age of 40) the tradition of theStanley Brothers, he was able to build on it. The Clinch Mountain Boys circa 1971--Stanley, Curly Ray Cline, Roy Lee Centers, and Jack Cooke--already ranked among the elite ensembles in bluegrass before Stanley added the talents of young bucksKeith WhitleyandRicky Skaggs. This glorious four-CD box is at once a celebration of Stanley\'s return to peak form and a thorough and thoroughly rewarding investigation of this classic period in Clinch Mountain Boys history. All facets of this band are revealed: breakneck traditional fiddle and banjo tunes, scintillating a cappella gospel harmonies, rousing live cuts from their 1971 Japanese tour, old-time favorites from theCarter Family, and, of course, a full slate of Stanley Brothers classics.

Granted Hanson and their record label drafted some well-connected producers, writers, and session players to beef up their platinum debut,Middle of Nowhere, but the brothers themselves were already comparatively seasoned live performers.  This 73-minute concert souvenir, shot during their 1998 Albertane tour, underscores that ambition--it was produced and directed by the group, with an assist from their father.The resulting portrait is exuberant, optimistic, a little brash, and inevitably a little self-congratulatory.  When the brothers kick off the concert footage with "Gimme Some Lovin\'," they give props to an earlier blue-eyed soul prodigy, Steve Winwood (who sang and cowrote the original as a member of the Spencer Davis Group), while serving notice that they\'re capable of playing with the big boys.  Backstage interviews and press conference clips reflect Hanson\'s obvious awareness of time-honored rock personae, with youngest brother Zac inevitably playing the wise guy while his elders knit their brows to provide more thoughtful answers.The cameras discreetly avoid the band\'s sidemen to focus on the three stars, and frequent shifts from film to video stock, sudden changes in focus, and telltale vagaries in synching suggest Hanson\'s desire for credibility hasn\'t dissuaded them from allowing the sort of post-production sweetening now commonplace for concert tapings.

And Ball doesn\'t need to dip into blues history for a bawdy song; she proves she can write her own on &quot;The Right Tool for the Job.&quot; The rest of the album isn\'t quite so blunt, but whether she\'s admitting she &quot;Can\'t Trust My Heart&quot; or declaring there\'s &quot;Something I Can\'t Do,&quot; Ball locks her voice and piano parts so firmly into the syncopated Gulf Coast rhythms that there always seems to be a party in full swing on this recording.The album is dominated by the sights and sounds of Ball\'s native Louisiana, from the culinary delights of Clarence Garlow\'s &quot;Crawfishin\'&quot; to the ironic history of Randy Newman\'s &quot;Louisiana 1927.&quot; Ball is now based in Austin, however, and she is backed by some of the finest blues musicians in Texas, including Clarence Hollimon, who plays guitar on &quot;I\'m Just a Prisoner,&quot; and Doyle Bramhall, who sings the duet vocal on &quot;How Big a Fool.&quot; Ball doesn\'t possess the strongest voice in the blues world, but few revivalists can match her instinctive grasp of rhythmic phrasing.--Geoffrey Himes', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516FmbTq0qL._SY300_.jpg', 16.0, true),

In a bonus episode titled "What Was Blue\'s Dream About?", the much more awake--but quaintly clueless--Steve works to decipher a number of characters\' dreams.

It was also voted Album of the Year at the 20th annual Grammy Awards in 1978. Fleetwood Mac had already been in existence for over a decade by the timeRumourscame out.

It was 1974, and the stage was set for a new chapter in the band\'s career. The eponymously titledFleetwood Mac, the first album with the new lineup, went platinum in 1976 and gave birth to hits like "Rhiannon" and "Say You Love Me." However, its success was soon overshadowed by that ofRumours.Released in February 1977,Rumoursreached #1 in the U.S. album chart in April of that year and found equal success in the U.K. In January 1978, its hit singles included "Go Your Own Way," "Don\'t Stop, Dreams" (which reached #1 in the Billboard Hot 100), and "You Make Loving Fun." Ironically,Rumourswas recorded during a period when John and Christine McVie were separating, and Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham\'s relationship was also breaking up.

Thanks to the media hoopla over Rounder\'s reissue of the Alan Lomax recordings and the Smithsonian\'s reissue of Harry Smith\'sAnthology of American Folk Music, there\'s much greater interest in the music of the pre-World War II rural South than in decades. Molsky grew up in New York City, but he got his musical education in the Southern Appalachian Mountains where he studied with such homegrown masters as Tommy Jarrell. Two decades later, Molsky became one of the genre\'s veterans, and he plays these ancient Celtic-African-American tunes with the authority and patience of someone who is way past trying to impress anyone.This old-timey music predates the bright tone and fast tempos of bluegrass as well as the sing-along melodies and rousing sentiments of \'60s folk music. This is a slower, darker music that came out of mountain communities where death was a constant threat and Saturday night a brief respite. Molsky digs his bow into his fiddle-strings as if the resulting drones and bird cries might suggest the anxiety of that threat and the yearning for that respite. The fiddler, who also sings and plays banjo, is joined by guitarist Beverly Smith and fiddler/banjo player Rafe Stefanini. Their album includes two songs from the Harry SmithAnthology--&quot;Wagoner\'s Lad&quot; and &quot;Train on the Island.&quot; Songs such as &quot;Pretty Saro&quot; and instrumentals such as &quot;Shove the Pig\'s Foot a Little Bit Further into the Fire&quot; are strange and powerful enough to have found a place.--Geoffrey Himes', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51U7SisfndL._SY300_.jpg', 15.99, true),

Jaubert, who died in World War II, is of special  interest; he composed some 40 movie soundtracks, but his atmospheric, neo- romantic love songs are totally unfamiliar, at least in the United States, and  well worth knowing.Lott is absent from most of the disc, which is taken up with two of the 19th  century\'s finest works for chamber orchestra: Wagner\'sSiegfried-Idyll,  probably the most endearing of his compositions, and the relaxed, warmly lyrical  Serenade No. 1 of Johannes Brahms. Both have been arranged for this group but  retain their attractions. This concert was taped (presumably for French  television) in the Maisons Laffitte Castle, an environment visually appropriate  for the music, and Armin Jordan conducts performances as elegant as the decor.

Lerner\'s complete coverage of the group\'s appearance, generally considered by true believers to be among their greatest shows, can be seen in this excellent concert film. A full year after the band\'s ragged concert at Woodstock (at which guitarist Pete Townshend, according to legend, was suffering the ill effects of a drug-spiked drink), the Who brought their potent act to the troubled Isle of Wight fest, making rock & roll history with a magnificent noise.

He is not without a sense of humor; at one point he describes how he broke with his family by "walking away from our ice-cream-cone-shaped swimming pool." But Robbins takes his mission seriously, buttressing his strong opinions about how America must reform its diet with commentary from physicians and academics, including some experts from Cornell University who appear on camera. Robbins himself visits farms where pigs, cattle, and chicken are raised in hellish conditions to make the point that modern meat production is inhumane. Much of this video comes across as being commonsense dietary advice, though some of the more extreme statements by experts are no doubt debatable.

Salinas plays both electric and acoustic guitar on this set of his own compositions, fronting a quartet that includes the popular Sammy Figueroa on percussion. At first blush, given the continuous layer of synth violins, the sound seems to fit the familiar formula of "smooth" jazz. Yet while the music is largely relaxed, it\'s more varied and interesting than the usual "lite" fare -- it has real drums and a clear sense of direction. Salinas offers a personalized mix of bossa nova, salsa, Argentinian folk music, bolero, and jazz; the percussive accents and expressive range of the guitar and piano keep the mix from blending too smooth. Most of the tunes are taken at mid-tempo; the distinctive high points are the ballads. Salinas captures the dreamy sound of Jobim\'s melodic successor on "For Ivan Lins," and sings in Spanish with considerable soul and class on his beautiful "Count on Me" and "Back to the Place I Love"; on the latter, he also salutes one of his mentors, George Benson, when he vocalizes the guitar lines. The closer is "Blue Zamba," a lovely solo track that belongs squarely in the tradition of the great Latin acoustic players, but with a whiff of Joe Pass as well.

There is for example, a rich and satisfying sound to the band on the opening JUST FOR LAUGHS which exists here more as two separate takes rather than two parts of the same performance. Perhaps the most memorable titles are those on which the tempo stays in the ballad vein and Mingus was moved by the personalities of the persons to whom he dedicated the works. CAROLINE KEKKI MINGUS was for his daughter; the last, as it happened, of a series of musical portraits devoted to ladies related to the composer. FAREWELL FARWELL, also sometimes referred to as FARWELL FAREWELL received this title after Mingus\'s lifelong friend FARWELL Taylor passed away. And DUKE ELLINGTON\'S SOUND OF LOVE needs little or no explanation for Duke always figured large in Mingus\'s gallery of heroes. Either by design or accident this work interpolates a phrase from LUSH LIFE, a song not written by Ellington but by his colleague Billy Strayhorn. It seems safe to assume that Mingus was aware of the authorship and introduced the fragment deliberately, in order to draw attention to the inseparable nature of the Ellington-Strayhorn partnership for so many years. Of the remaining works FABLES OF FAUBUS is Mingus\'s last recording of the music he wrote in order to commemorate the actions of Orval E. Faubus, State Governor, who did his best to prevent the integration of the school system in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1957. This was often performed (and recorded) with a spoken lyric in the course of which Faubus hardly emerged with a great deal of credit. And the staple PEGGY\'S BLUE SKYLIGHT and his only recording? of his composition IT MIGHT AS WELL BE SPRING. SLOP has an interesting history for it was composed by Mingus as part of the score for a CBS television ballet presentation. Those familiar with Mingus\'s music will recognize the obvious references to the earliest work BETTER GIT IT IN YOUR SOUL, a deliberate attempt to satisfy the choreographer\'s wishes. SO LONG ERIC is a blues dedicated to the late Eric Dolphy. But it was not written as a musical obituary; composed while Dolphy was alive it refers to Eric\'s desire to leave the Mingus unit and spend some time in Europe.

Fagen, with his close-cropped hair, austere beard, tinted glasses, and prominent incisors resembles a pale, vampiric Ray Charles as he huddles over his keyboards and croons those dangerous lyrics. His partner\'s longer locks and steel-rimmed glasses reinforce the spectre of a postbop Franz Schubert who\'s traded clavichords for custom electric guitars--a studious image reinforced by his dry, articulate gibes in the interviews, if undercut by the twisted imagery and shadowy, second-person perspectives pervasive in the band\'s lyrics (like the music, written by both men, but conspicuously shaped by Becker).The material hews to the  group\'s later albums recorded after they downsized the band into a de facto studio laboratory and dialed up the jazz accents, with understandable showcases for the sneaky new songs on theTwo Against Naturealbum: sleek, seductive songs about incest, midlife crises, pyromania, designer drugs, and other fun stuff. Sonically, the performances are as meticulously recorded and mixed as the duo\'s albums, with the performance footage beautifully shot and edited. We\'d knock director Earle Sebastian for a few too many tilted camera angles, but then we might have to wait another  19&nbsp;years for the next one.--Sam Sutherland', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517T8W49QPL._SY300_.jpg', 8.91, true),

The way in which the piece shifts between quiet yearning and wild abandon never fails to be exciting--in short, it\'s really hard to ruin the audience\'s enjoyment of this piece. That said, this is a relatively enjoyable performance. The conductor certainly knows where to make things happen and the playing is mostly good. This group, the Montpellier Philharmonic Orchestra  (which looks pretty young), doesn\'t always play together, but they do play with spirit. The only things one may find unfortunate are some balance problems. First, this performance seems to follow a trend some conductors have established of boosting the violins way up in the mix while practically silencing the woodwinds. Second, it\'s a shame that now even French orchestras have trumpet sections that are intent on obliterating the rest of the group. The accompanying song cycle,Les Nuits d\'&eacute;t&eacute;, is performed quite well. Ms.&nbsp;Pollet  sings with a lot of soul, and the orchestra accompanies her very sensitively.

They are, of course, entitled to this delusion, but it  creates serious obstacles for a vital form of new music and it deprives  opera fans of some memorable theatrical experiences. For most of the  20th century and very intensively in its last half, American composers  have been transforming literary masterpieces into operas that deserve  and are gradually winning a place in the repertoire with the European  classics. WithA Streetcar Named Desire(1998), Andr&eacute;  Previn is the latest addition to the list of these composers, with Gian  Carlo Menotti, Dominick Argento, John Corigliano, Carlisle Floyd, John  Harbison, William Bolcom, Mark Adamo, and others.Previn came to classical music from a background as a jazz pianist and  soundtrack composer, credentials that may raise a few eyebrows but  obviously developed his sense of what works dramatically in music and a  knack for regional flavor in an opera set in New Orleans. The libretto  preserves the impact of the original Tennessee Williams play about the  fragile Blanche DuBois (brilliantly portrayed by Ren&eacute;e Fleming)  and the loutish Stanley Kowalski (sung with precision and a subtle  sense of character by Rodney Gilfry). There are no weaknesses in the  supporting cast and there are particularly fine performances by  Elizabeth Futral and Anthony Dean Griffey. Previn, a world-class  conductor, is of course an expert in his own music, and Kirk Browning  has a convincing approach to the opera\'s visual elements.

You can get tired just watching Turner, as she challenges her audience to maintain the same energy level throughout an entire performance. This disc captures 180,000 people in Rio, towards the backside of Turner\'s \'80s comeback, trying to keep pace. Sadly, the soundboard man failed. During this 75-minute show, in which Turner and her ultra-slick band perform 13 numbers, it sounds as if the Acid Queen is singing in a backstage bathroom. Though you can see veins popping out of her neck as she belts out lyrics for "Better Be Good to Me" to ballads like "Private Dancer," the vocals sound buried in the mix. This flaw calls attention to Turner\'s shortcomings. While she\'s definitely a great screamer (check out "Proud Mary"), she\'s far from a great singer. Her limited, whinny range most noticeably falls short on nearly every ballad she attempts. Her voice cracks repeatedly during a cover of Al Green\'s "Let\'s Stay Together," and a misguided reworking of the Beatles\' "Help."

Pippin leads the orchestra in instrumental medleys of waltzes and marches, Liza Minnelli, Paul and Linda McCartney, and Angela Lansbury offered prerecorded greetings, and humorous moments are provided by Luft\'s grouchy "Put It Back On" response to the dance team\'s "Take It All Off" (the producers make it up to her later by giving herMack & Mabel\'s great ballad "Time Heals Everything"). There\'s also Reams\'s  impressions of Channing, Pearl Bailey, and Louis Armstrong performing "Hello, Dolly"; and Arthur, who explains thatMamewas not named after her character simply because nothing would rhyme with "Vera"--though "Sondheim could have done it."

After 14 albums on such regional labels as Hacienda, Joey, and Espada,I Love My Freedom, I Love My Texasis his first album aimed at the Anglo market. Carl Finch, leader of the interracial Texan band Brave Combo, picked out 13 titles from all phases of Saldivar\'s career and then produced rerecordings of them, with an all-star band featuring Oscar Tellez, at the modern studios of Joey Records in West San Antonio. It was Saldivar who pioneered the fusion of Tejano conjunto and country music, and this collection includes his bilingual adaptations of the country hits &quot;Marie&quot; and &quot;Ring of Fire,&quot; with Saldivar\'s fluttering button accordion grabbing hold of the bouncy two-step beat that unites the two genres. Even on his arrangements of traditional Mexican tunes, Saldivar injects the plaintive, honky-tonk feel of North American country music--in clear contrast to the bluesier feel of conjunto stars like Estaban Jordan and Flaco Jimenez. There\'s a lilting lyricism to Saldivar\'s playing that makes this album a welcome addition to any collection of Tex-Mex music.

But that very thing has transpired for decades in the Jewel and Keith Dominions of the Church of the Living God, and, as this mid-\'90s recording demonstrates, the results are brilliant. Sonny Treadway displays the agile virtuosity ofChet Atkinson "At the Cross" and Glenn Lee\'s mournful, nimble, dulcet licks on "Call Him by His Name" recallB.B. Kingat his fiercest. However, such facile comparisons really do a disservice to this vital sound; none of this music really resembles anything else. Particular highlights of this satisfying set\'s 20 tracks are the 3 sublime contributions by Willie Eason. The elderly Eason may not display the liquid bravado of others here, but his songs possess unbounded soul. His original composition "Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Poor Man\'s Friend" is a wonderful example of both topical material and eulogy in gospel music. His songs are sung in a baritone, preach-singing style and the playing juxtaposes strummed chords with eerie, long, looping notes that seem to hang in the air forever. The section of live religious services by Treadway, Henry Nelson, and Aubrey Ghent are stomping fun at its most sanctified.

With Tut Taylor, Norman Blake, and Charlie Collins (another Smoky Mountain Boy) in support, Os demonstrates an easygoing grace and pristine beauty in his Dobro work; speed is not an issue. "Sailing Along the Highway," an original he\'d developed in the early \'30s, is hypnotic in its gentle sway. On "Farewell Blues," he shows his command of the instrument and a full knowledge of its sonic capabilities. Also here are pop chestnuts; Hawaiian songs learned from a native islander, Rudy Waikiki, whom Os had met at Flint, Michigan, house parties while working for Buick in 1929; and, of course, a number of songs from the Acuff book. "Wabash Cannonball" becomes a mellow Dobro trio with Taylor and Blake, and "Tennessee Waltz," recorded by Acuff and Os years before it was a hit, is simply delightful as Oswald wisely lets the melody do all the work for him.--Marc Greilsamer', 'http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rnDKd0FcL._SY300_.jpg', 16.67, true),

The album is at once a tribute to the early bluegrass that so inspired Rice, and a reflection of the changes Rice helped bring to bluegrass. On the traditional songs associated with Bill Monroe, Flatt & Scruggs, the Stanley Brothers, Jimmy Martin, and Hylo Brown, Rice sounds right at home pushing those insistent rhythms along and leading those note-bending vocal harmonies. Several other songs, including Bob Dylan\'s &quot;Girl from the North Country&quot; and Tom Rush\'s &quot;Galveston Flood,&quot; were introduced to the bluegrass repertoire by the Country Gentlemen, and Rice uses them to illustrate the changes that shook bluegrass in the \'70s: a more personal, conversational vocal style, a broader harmonic palette, and an increased prominence for guitar leads.

The DVD edition adds a premium level of special features and exclusive content.The music\'s the main thing, of course, and on that frontOne Loveis uniformly respectful, orbiting around Marley\'s songs and infused with whiffs of his Rastafarian world view and reggae\'s broader Third World perspectives. Marley\'s family members serve as hosts and frequent collaborators, with a limber house band further reinforcing a coherent, communal element to the performances, and the titular all-stars immerse themselves in Marley\'s world. Lauryn Hill opens the concert with what is clearly one of its highest points, a joyful "Turn the Lights Down Low." Chrissie Hynde and Erykah Badu take turns duetting with Jimmy Cliff, and another reggae titan, Toots Hibbert, proves a perfect, ebullient fit with a current lineup of the Wailers. The celebrity choices include a conspicuous subset of American folk-rockers in Tracy Chapman, Ben Harper, and Hootie and the Blowfish\'s Darius Rucker, with Chapman the most convincing in a glowing version of "Three Little Birds."Avid reggae fans may be mildly frustrated by the overall crossover thrust of this homage, which favors Yankee rap and hip-hop (via Busta Rhymes and Queen Latifah) instead of homegrown dancehall; it tantalizes us with glimpses of Marley\'s peers, like Cliff and Hibbert, while being largely occupied with sustaining its parade of non-reggae marquee names.

The band who was originally known as Audioform released its second album, Curious Poses, in late June (its fourth if you count its output with Audioform and what incredible cover art). The first track begins with cool cat vocals spelling out the band s mission against the backdrop of a trembling, scale-climbing sax. It s as if the curtains of the smoke-filled VIP room of the underground s version of Studio 54 just parted. Is that Richard Roundtree? The second track, Candles and Incense, is a more straight-forward come-on and features vocals, which is a rarity for the predominantly instrumental group. So what do they sing about? The kind of night out you might experience hooking up in said smoky dance club circa 1979. After the vocal segue things get gritty and funky on guitar with big lyrical horns leading the way on The Stand. The drama escalates on the title track. The percussion and repeating guitar line in Time and Place set the stage for an old-fashioned horn-off (if there s such a thing). Derrick Bartell s keys and Keith Whatley and Chris Spivey s guitars get in on the action too as instruments alternate leads - but those solos don t go overlong. Whatley seems like such an underrated player and this track in particular gives him room to exercise his inner Hendrix. The playing is fun and loose, but tasteful. The players never go overboard. Groove 8 always reins its jams back in without getting too showy. There seems to be purpose and the musicians, many of who have been playing together for years, read each other like only seasoned players can. There s an ease to it all that translates to the audience. It relaxes.  To say its music is cinematic is only touching the surface. The changes, the juxtaposition of squalling electric guitar and punchy horns, the repeating rhythm at the heart of a song, a subtle phrase returning at the right time - all these elements create drama so the listener can create a corresponding mini movie in in their minds (if they\'re so inclined - I\'m a visual listener) --Charlotte Observer', 'http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-lg._V192198674_.gif', 337.83, true),

Using his custom Anglo C & G concertina, John Williams explains all the basics: how to hold the instrument; how to get the most power out of your bellows; and how to use the buttons and the versatile C and G scales. Follow along with John as he explains slowed-down, then up-to-speed versions of each tune in split-screen detail. Before you know it, you\'ll be playing the familiar Irish children\'s song, "Or&#xF3; (S&#xE9; Do Bheatha Bhaile)!"The stereo effect of producing two simultaneous tones (muffled and clear) and of double-octave style playing are both essential techniques. John uses them--as well as the legato capabilities of cross-fingering and a focus on bellows work--to illustrate that developing various skills makes it possible to play one melody in several different ways.The catchy "Jimmy Ward\'s Jig" provides a great opportunity to use the air button, master the alternate C pattern, and begin to add a few simple ornaments. Switching to another concertina, John examines the popular session tune "Kesh Jig," using it to introduce new buttons and give advice for better tone production.John teaches chords, triplets, pick-up notes and more ornaments, then illustrates the common practice of playing jigs in sequence. When his note-for-note breakdown of "Bobby\'s Casey\'s Jig" (in A minor) is complete, John performs this string of jigs so you can hear how they sound together at a moderate pace. He completes this thorough concertina overview with a rousing reel, "Last Night\'s Fun," which introduces additional notes used when playing in the key of D.As you work your way through this Irish concertina lesson, John shows you how to deliver a tune with good volume, clarity, snap and rhythm.
